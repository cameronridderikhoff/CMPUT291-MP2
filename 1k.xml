In the Southwest&#10;temperatures will be about 3.5 degree above normal.&#10; At the California-Oregon Border, heavy load power fell&#10;$172.00 from yesterday to $430.00-$475.00.&#10; &quot;What happened to all of this bitter cold weather we were&#10;supposed to have,&apos;&apos; said one Northwest power marketer. Since the&#10;weather is not as cold as expected prices are drastically lower.&quot;&#10; Temperatures in Los Angeles today will peak at 66 degrees,&#10;and are expected to rise to 74 degrees this weekend.&#10; Natural gas to be delivered to the California Oregon from the&#10;El Paso Pipeline traded between $20-$21, down $3 from yesterday.&#10; &quot;Gas prices are declining causing western daily power prices&#10;to fall,&apos;&apos; said one Northwest power trader.&#10; At the NP-15 delivery point heavy load power decreased&#10;$206.25 from yesterday to $325.00-$450.00. Light load energy fell&#10;to $200.00-$350.00, falling $175.00 from yesterday.&#10; PSC of New Mexico&apos;s 498-megawatt San Juan Unit 4 coal plant&#10;was shut down this morning for a tube leak. The unit is scheduled&#10;to restart this weekend.&#10; At the Four Corners located in New Mexico, power traded at&#10;$325.00-$335.00 plunging $182.50 from yesterday.&#10;&#10;-Robert Scalabrino&#10;&#10;&#10;PJM Spot Power Prices Dip With Weather, Falling Natural Gas&#10;&#10; Philadelphia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Peak next-day&#10;power prices declined at the western hub of the Pennsylvania-New&#10;Jersey-Maryland Interconnection amid warmer weather forecasts and&#10;falling natural gas prices, traders said.&#10; The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power at western&#10;PJM declined an average of $12.75 a megawatt-hour, with trades&#10;ranging from $62.00-$76.00.&#10; Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.&#10;forecast tomorrow&apos;s high temperature in Philadelphia at 40 degrees&#10;Fahrenheit, up 7 degrees from today&apos;s expected high. Temperatures&#10;could climb as high as 42 degrees by Friday.&#10; &quot;Most of the day&apos;s activity took place in the early part of&#10;the morning,&quot; said one PJM-based trader. &quot;By options expiration&#10;the market had pretty much dried up.&quot;&#10; Traders said that falling natural gas prices were the main&#10;reason for the decline in spot market prices.&#10; Bloomberg figures show that spot natural gas delivered to the&#10;New York City Gate declined an average of $1.25 per million&#10;British thermal units to $8.60-$8.90 per million Btu. Since&#10;Monday, delivered natural gas prices have declined an average of&#10;$2.44 per million Btu, as revised 6-10 day weather forecasts&#10;indicated reduced utility load requirements.&#10; In New York, prices rose as utilities withheld supplies they&#10;normally would have sold, fearing a sudden change in weather&#10;forecast could force them into high-priced hourly markets.&#10; Peak next-day power at the Zone A delivery point sold $6.13&#10;higher at a Bloomberg index price of $70.33, amid trades in the&#10;$67.00-$75.00 range. Power at Zone J sold $7.50 higher at $90.00-&#10;$92.00.&#10; ~&#10;-Karyn Rispoli&#10;&#10;&#10;Mid-Continent Power Prices Drop on Revised Forecast, Gas Prices&#10;&#10; Cincinnati, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Mid-Continent&#10;next-day peak power prices plunged as forecasts were revised&#10;warmer and natural gas values continued to decline, traders said.&#10; The Bloomberg index price for peak Thursday power on the&#10;Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system dropped $23.19&#10;to $67.90 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $75.00 as the&#10;market opened down to $59.00 after options expired.&#10; In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, peak power on&#10;the Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison Co. grid sold $21.37 lower&#10;on average at $60.00-$75.00, while power in lower MAIN sold $18.17&#10;lower at $65.00-$100.00.&#10; Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc. predicted&#10;high temperatures would average 2 degrees Fahrenheit above normal&#10;in Chicago and at normal levels in Cincinnati over the next seven&#10;days, up from 6 and 4 degrees below normal Monday, respectively.&#10; Traders said falling spot natural gas values also pulled&#10;prices down. Natural gas prices were a large factor in recent&#10;electricity market surges because of a heavy reliance on gas-fired&#10;generation to meet increased weather-related demand.&#10; Spot natural gas at the Cincinnati city gate sold an average&#10;of 95 cents less than yesterday at $7.80-$8.30 per million British&#10;thermal units. Spot gas at the Chicago city gate sold an average&#10;of 80 cents less at $7.65-$8.15 per million Btu.&#10; &quot;The weather&apos;s moderating and gas is down, so you&apos;ve got&#10;people coming to their senses,&quot; one trader said. &quot;These are much&#10;more realistic prices.&quot;&#10; Traders said prices could decline further tomorrow if the&#10;outlook for weather continues to be mild. Peak Cinergy power for&#10;delivery from Dec. 18-22 was offered at $60.00, down from $90.00&#10;yesterday.&#10; Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices plunged&#10;with warmer weather forecasts and increased available transmission&#10;capacity, selling $37.67 less in northern MAPP and $44.17 less in&#10;southern MAPP at $75.00-$125.00.&#10; &quot;What&apos;s happening is the people who don&apos;t have firm&#10;transmission are getting into the market early and buying at those&#10;high prices since they have no choice,&quot; one MAPP trader said.&#10; &quot;Then you&apos;ve got some people who were lucky enough to get a&#10;firm path who waited until later in the morning when ComEd prices&#10;fell off,&quot; he said, &quot;and bought from them at those lower prices,&#10;causing the huge gap between the day&apos;s high and low trade.&quot;&#10;&#10;-Ken Fahnestock&#10;&#10;&#10;Southeast U.S. Electricity Prices Slump After Mild Forecast&#10;&#10; Atlanta, Georgia, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Southeast&#10;U.S. peak spot power prices slumped today after warmer weather was&#10;forecast for the region this week, traders said.&#10; Traders said Southeast utility demand has been reduced since&#10;many large population centers like Atlanta will see temperatures&#10;climb into the mid-50s Fahrenheit later this week.&#10; &quot;There was nothing going on in Florida today,&quot; said one&#10;southern energy trader. &quot;Everything was going to markets in the&#10;north.&quot;&#10; Traders said supply was being routed from Florida into&#10;markets on the Entergy Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority&#10;grid in the mid-$70s a megawatt-hour.&#10; &quot;Prices into TVA started in the $80s and $90s and crumbled as&#10;forecasts came out,&quot; said on Entergy power trader. &quot;Prices,&#10;declined to $60 and less.&quot;&#10; The Bloomberg into TVA index price fell an average of $23.95&#10;to $70.25 amid trades in the $65.00-$80.00 range. Off-peak trades&#10;were noted at $32.00, several dollars higher than recent&#10;estimates.&#10; Southeast power traders said revised 6-10 day weather&#10;forecasts and lower temperatures for the balance of this week&#10;caused prices to decline in the region.&#10; In the Southwest Power Pool, traders said warmer weather was&#10;the main culprit behind lower prices.&#10; &quot;The cold weather&apos;s backing off,&quot; said one SPP utility&#10;trader. &quot;It was minus 35 degrees with the wind chill yesterday and&#10;today it&apos;s about 9 degrees with the wind chill. Yesterday, it was&#10;bitter cold and today it was just plain cold.&quot;&#10; Power sold in northern sections of SPP at $78-$100, though&#10;the Bloomberg index sank an average of 39.00 to $88.00. Southern&#10;SPP traded at $82.00, $2 more than yesterday.&#10;&#10;-Brian Whary&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;U.K. Day-Ahead Electricity Prices Rise Amid Increased Demand&#10;&#10; London, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Electricity prices in&#10;the U.K. rose today after falling temperatures were expected to&#10;increase household consumption for space heating, traders said.&#10; The day-ahead baseload Pool Purchase Price, calculated by the&#10;Electricity Pool of England and Wales, rose 1.46 pounds to 20.01&#10;pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10; Temperatures across the U.K. were forecast to fall 6 degrees&#10;to 4 degrees Celsius by the weekend, according to Weather Services&#10;Corp. in the U.S.&#10; Day-ahead Electricity Forward Agreements dealt at 19.7-20.15&#10;pounds a megawatt-hour, 2.1 pounds higher than yesterday.&#10; December continued to fall amid a combination of position&#10;closing prior to its expiry and continued belief that demand will&#10;not rise sufficiently to justify high winter prices, traders said.&#10; December 2000 baseload EFAs traded at 17.9-18.05 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, 40 pence below yesterday&apos;s last trade.&#10; First quarter and its constituent months fell, in line with&#10;expectations that mild forecasts into the new year would continue&#10;to stifle demand, traders said.&#10; January 2001 baseload EFAs dealt between 24.6-24.73 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, falling 17 pence.&#10; First quarter 2001 baseload EFAs traded at 21.6-21.7 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour, 10 pence below its previous close.&#10; Season structures traded on the U.K. Power Exchange, summer&#10;2001 baseload trading unchanged at 18.15 pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10;Winter 2001 baseload dealt 5 pence higher at 21.75 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour.&#10; Open positions on many short-term structures will likely&#10;force many traders to deal actively on those contracts in the run-&#10;up to Christmas, traders said. Adding that other structures will&#10;probably remain illiquid until the new year, when demand can more&#10;easily be assessed.&#10;&#10;-Nick Livingstone&#10;&#10;&#10;Nordic Electricity Prices Climb Following Cold Weather Forecast&#10;&#10; Lysaker, Norway, Dec. 13 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices&#10;on the Nord Pool exchange in Lysaker, Norway, closed higher today&#10;as colder weather forecasts sparked active trade, traders said.&#10; Week 51 dealt between 145-152 Norwegian kroner a megawatt-&#10;hour, 6.62 kroner above yesterday&apos;s closing trade on 1,076&#10;megawatts of traded volume. Week 52 rose 6.25 kroner, with 446&#10;megawatts dealt between 134.50-140.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10; Supply from hydro-producers was expected to recede after&#10;forecasts indicated reduced precipitation over Scandinavia for&#10;next week. These producers typically generate power to prevent&#10;reservoirs from overflowing.&#10; Consumption, currently unseasonably low, was expected to rise&#10;with falling temperatures because of increased requirements for&#10;space heating.&#10; Traded volume on the power exchange increased in active&#10;trading on the beginning of typical winter conditions, traders&#10;said.&#10; &quot;The market&apos;s been waiting for this day for a long time,&quot; a&#10;Stockholm-based trader said. &quot;For too long, people have been&#10;selling because winter hasn&apos;t lived up to expectations. We should&#10;now see a noticeable increase in the spot price.&quot;&#10; Temperatures in parts of Scandinavia were forecast to fall&#10;below freezing to minus 5 degrees Celsius, with only limited&#10;chances for rain during the 5-day outlook, according to Weather&#10;Services Corp. in the U.S.&#10; The day-ahead system average area price fell after demand was&#10;expected to remain limited until next week, when forecasts predict&#10;temperatures to begin falling.&#10; Thursday&apos;s system area price fell 1.57 kroner, or 1.22&#10;percent, to 126.43 kroner a megawatt-hour. Traded volume fell&#10;4,134 megawatts to 295,414 megawatts.&#10; Many dealers anticipate that the spot price will likely rise&#10;by 10-15 kroner by the start of next week.&#10; Winter 1, 2001 forward structures rose in line with shorter-&#10;term contracts.&#10; Winter 1, 2001 dealt at 136.75-138.5 kroner a megawatt-hour,&#10;1.9 kroner below yesterday&apos;s last trade at 135.25 kroner a&#10;megawatt-hour.&#10; Also, the delayed restart at a Swedish nuclear unit, although&#10;expected, will likely allow abundant supply from hydro-producers&#10;to meet the increased demand, other traders said.&#10; Vattenfall&apos;s Ringhals 1, an 835-megawatt nuclear reactor,&#10;will delay its restart at least until week 52, the company said.&#10; Today&apos;s rapid increase was likely induced by traders who used&#10;today&apos;s news to gain momentum for future increases, traders said.&#10;&#10;-Nick Livingstone&#10;-0- (BES) Dec/13/2000 21:04 GMT&#10;=0F$&#10;&#10;&#10; - daily.pdf</body></mail>

The land is selling for $2.50 per square&#10;foot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West&#10;San Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.&#10;&#10;Several new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes&#10;and for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25&#10;per square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and&#10;$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room. This&#10;property will have the best location for student housing of all new&#10;projects, just as the duplexes do now.&#10;&#10;If this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there&#10;is a very, very short window of opportunity.

<mail><row>14</row><date>2000/09/28</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>lkuch@mh.com</to><subj>San Juan Index</subj><cc></cc><bcc></bcc><body>---------------------- Forwarded by Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT on 09/28/2000 &#10;01:09 PM ---------------------------&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; From: Phillip K Allen 09/28/2000 10:56 AM&#10; &#10;&#10;&#10;Liane,&#10;&#10; As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there may have been an attempt to &#10;manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. It appears that a single &#10;buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above &#10;market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, &#10;offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were &#10;bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index &#10;calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated &#10;financial swaps for San Juan.&#10;&#10; We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from &#10;September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from &#10;Enron Online (EOL), Enron&apos;s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage &#10;firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a &#10;trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas &#10;daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread &#10;relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:&#10;&#10; 1. The high physical prices on the 26th &amp; 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater &#10;than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. &#10;&#10; 2.

<mail><row>15</row><date>2000/09/28</date><from>phillip.allen@enron.com</from><to>jeffrey.hodge@enron.com</to><subj>San Juan Index</subj><cc></cc><bcc></bcc><body>Liane,&#10;&#10; As we discussed yesterday, I am concerned there has been an attempt to &#10;manipulate the El Paso San Juan monthly index. A single buyer entered the &#10;marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices &#10;($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index. At the &#10;time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 &#10;cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to &#10;report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of &#10;line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.&#10;&#10; We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from &#10;September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from &#10;Enron Online (EOL), Enron&apos;s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage &#10;firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a &#10;trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas &#10;daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread &#10;relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows:&#10;&#10; 1. The high physical prices on the 26th &amp; 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater &#10;than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. &#10;&#10; 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal &amp; &#10;Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and &#10; October gas daily. It doesn&apos;t make sense to have monthly indeces that &#10;are dramatically different.&#10;&#10;&#10; I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.

Crocker&quot; &#10;&lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt; &#10;Subject: Investment Structure&#10;&#10;&#10;STRUCTURE:&#10;Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)&#10;general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the&#10;liability of construction.&#10;&#10;LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS&#10;The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and&#10;any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in&#10;the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and&#10;all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the&#10;loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means&#10;that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor&apos;s share of profits&#10;is reduced.&#10;&#10;All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are&#10;full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,&#10;the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be&#10;non-recourse.&#10;&#10;USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT&#10;The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;&#10;architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for&#10;organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike&#10;many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to&#10;Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over&#10;the estimated 6 month design and approval period.&#10;&#10;EARLY LAND COSTS&#10;The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost&#10;represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of&#10;extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at&#10;probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase&#10;price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated&#10;monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus&#10;approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.&#10;&#10;EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN&#10;Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require&#10;the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as&#10;the &quot;fiscals&quot;. This cost represents a bond for the completion of&#10;improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the&#10;improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be&#10;for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after&#10;completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should&#10;expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot&#10;improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an&#10;irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a&#10;development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not&#10;spent no interest is charged on these funds.&#10;&#10;The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a&#10;finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as&#10;high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000&#10;per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, &apos;fiscals&apos; at&#10;$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000&#10;which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to&#10;obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement&#10;provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the&#10;improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would&#10;cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds&#10;spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the&#10;preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a&#10;tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can&#10;significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.&#10;&#10;Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total&#10;lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably&#10;$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The&#10;improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design&#10;costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and&#10;landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for&#10;undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would&#10;estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the&#10;loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give&#10;you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required&#10;of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing&#10;is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the&#10;separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility&#10;standpoint.&#10;&#10;CONSTRUCTION LOANS&#10;There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative&#10;(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is&#10;a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the&#10;builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction&#10;loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to&#10;start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans&#10;in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any&#10;construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too&#10;difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.&#10;&#10;Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for&#10;pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will&#10;be from 80% to 95% of value.&#10;&#10;DISBURSEMENTS&#10;Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and&#10;near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority&#10;payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner&#10;will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the&#10;fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to&#10;15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.&#10;These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to&#10;calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership&#10;expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has&#10;to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or&#10;cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this&#10;function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain&#10;from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.&#10;Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is&#10;used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own&#10;any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track&#10;to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.&#10;&#10;REPORTING&#10;We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.&#10;What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based&#10;reporting.&#10;&#10;BOOKKEEPING&#10;I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, &quot;Bookkeeping&#10;procedures to record actual expenses?&quot; Please expand.&#10;&#10;INVESTOR INPUT&#10;We are glad to have the investor&apos;s input on design and materials. As always&#10;the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my&#10;experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume&#10;Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every&#10;effort to be accommodating.&#10;&#10;CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES&#10;CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as&#10;formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market&#10;obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional&#10;subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,&#10;for vendors they are constantly shopped.&#10;&#10;PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS&#10;Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can&#10;provide these if you are interested.&#10;&#10;I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point.

As you can tell from the proforma this project&#10;should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.&#10;This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as&#10;Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for&#10;this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we&#10;have uncovered to date in the Austin market.&#10;The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As&#10;it is in the &quot;Smart Growth Corridor&quot; area designated by the City of Austin&#10;for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete&#10;in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe&#10;water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot&#10;improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North&#10;Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street&#10;widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street&#10;widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond&#10;requirement, I used this data to be cautious.&#10; The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not&#10;expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite&#10;successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the&#10;adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.&#10;As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods&#10;is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may&#10;only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far&#10;preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer&#10;preferences.&#10;The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and&#10;an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site&#10;plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into&#10;an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.&#10;This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the&#10;profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss&#10;having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity&#10;with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a&#10;1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a&#10;rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then&#10;be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an&#10;exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San&#10;Antonio if you do not know anyone.&#10;I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,&#10;by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.&#10;Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to&#10;schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as&#10;your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any&#10;time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either&#10;512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is&#10;512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you&#10;on this project that is sure to be a major winner.&#10;I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual&#10;events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg&#10;downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.&#10;One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to&#10;start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough&#10;to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took&#10;another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take&#10;my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra&#10;in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this&#10;past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize&#10;the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as&#10;if she will be ok in the long run.&#10;George W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project&#10;should produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.&#10;This is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as&#10;Austin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for&#10;this market. This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we&#10;have uncovered to date in the Austin market.&#10;The project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan. As&#10;it is in the &quot;Smart Growth Corridor&quot; area designated by the City of Austin&#10;for preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete&#10;in less than 6 months. Additionally, many of the current and more severe&#10;water treatment ordinances have been waived. I have estimated the lot&#10;improvement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North&#10;Austin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street&#10;widening. Even though this property is not likely to require street&#10;widening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond&#10;requirement, I used this data to be cautious.&#10; The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not&#10;expected to impact sales significantly. Other projects have been quite&#10;successful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the&#10;adjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.&#10;As with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods&#10;is uneven. We have included a fence around the entire property, but may&#10;only put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop. Gated communities are far&#10;preferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer&#10;preferences.&#10;The seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and&#10;an extended escrow. This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site&#10;plan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into&#10;an A&amp;D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.&#10;This analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the&#10;profits of the project. As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss&#10;having you invest only in the lots, sell the lots to the construction entity&#10;with your profit in the lot. I believe this would facilitate the use of a&#10;1031 Exchange of the proceeds from this deal into another project that is a&#10;rental deal or at least into the land for a rental project that would then&#10;be the equity for that project. You would need to discuss this with an&#10;exchange expert first. Larry Lewter knows an expert in the field in San&#10;Antonio if you do not know anyone.&#10;I will send you a package on the property that was prepared by the broker,&#10;by Airborne Express today for Saturday delivery.&#10;Once you have read the package and reviewed this proforma, we would want to&#10;schedule a tour of the site and the area. Please get back to me as soon as&#10;your schedule permits regarding the site visit and feel free to call at any&#10;time. You can reach me over the weekend and in the evening at either&#10;512-338-1119 or 512-338-1110. My cell phone is 512-748-7495 and the fax is&#10;512-338-1103. I look forward to hearing from you and to working with you&#10;on this project that is sure to be a major winner.&#10;I regret that it took so long to get back to you, but we had some unusual&#10;events these past few weeks. A small freakish wind storm with severe 60+mpg&#10;downdrafts hit the South part of Austin where we are building 10 town homes.&#10;One of these units had just had the roof decked with the siding scheduled to&#10;start the next day. The severe downdraft hitting the decked roof was enough&#10;to knock it down. The City shut down the project for a week and it took&#10;another week to get every thing back on tract. Then last week I had to take&#10;my wife to emergency. She has a bulge in the material between the vertebra&#10;in her spine and it causes her extreme pain and has kept her bedridden this&#10;past week.. There is nothing like having your wife incapacitated to realize&#10;the enormous number of things she does everyday. Fortunately, it looks as&#10;if she will be ok in the long run.&#10;George W.

This would produce an average sq&#10;footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his&#10;sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell&#10;for $203,108.&#10;What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the&#10;rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own&#10;evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the&#10;3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we&#10;were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom&#10;units along with the 3-bedroom plan.&#10;Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.&#10;Sincerely,&#10;George W.

Sitting at the confluence of several &#10;fiber optic backbones, the&#10; Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and &#10;eventually&#10; house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, &#10;Microsoft and Onvia.com. &#10;&#10; Exodus is not the only company building massive data &#10;centers near Seattle.&#10; More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, &#10;Globix and&#10; HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house &#10;the networking&#10; equipment of the Internet economy. &#10;&#10; It is a big business that could have an effect on &#10;everything from your&#10; monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access &#10;your favorite Web sites.&#10;&#10; Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and &#10;server farms, are&#10; sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent &#10;Valley that some&#10; have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and &#10;Puget Sound&#10; Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, &#10;high-security&#10; facilities. &#10;&#10; &quot;We are talking to about half a dozen customers that &#10;are requesting 445&#10; megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall,&quot; &#10;said Karl&#10; Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound &#10;Energy. &quot;That is&#10; the equivalent of six oil refineries.&quot; &#10;&#10; A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, &#10;the rise of the Internet&#10; data center has some utility veterans scratching their &#10;heads. &#10;&#10; Puget Sound Energy last week asked the Washington &#10;Utilities and&#10; Transportation Commission to accept a tariff on the new &#10;data centers. The&#10; tariff is designed to protect the company&apos;s existing &#10;residential and business&#10; customers from footing the bill for the new base stations &#10;necessary to support&#10; the projects. Those base stations could cost as much as $20 &#10;million each,&#10; Karzmar said. &#10;&#10; Not to be left behind, Seattle City Light plans to &#10;bring up the data center&#10; issue on Thursday at the Seattle City Council meeting. &#10;&#10; For the utilities that provide power to homes, &#10;businesses and schools in the&#10; region, this is a new and complex issue. &#10;&#10; On one hand, the data centers -- with their amazing &#10;appetite for power --&#10; represent potentially lucrative business customers. The &#10;facilities run 24 hours a&#10; day, seven days a week, and therefore could become a &#10;constant revenue&#10; stream. On the other hand, they require so much energy that &#10;they could&#10; potentially flood the utilities with exorbitant capital &#10;expenditures. &#10;&#10; Who will pay for those expenditures and what it will &#10;mean for power rates&#10; in the area is still open to debate. &#10;&#10; &quot;These facilities are what we call extremely dense &#10;loads,&quot; said Bob Royer,&#10; director of communications and public affairs at Seattle &#10;City Light. &#10;&#10; &quot;The entire University of Washington, from stadium &#10;lights at the football&#10; game to the Medical School, averages 31 megawatts per day. &#10;We have data&#10; center projects in front of us that are asking for 30, 40 &#10;and 50 megawatts.&quot; &#10;&#10; With more than 1.5 million square feet, the Intergate &#10;complex in Tukwila is&#10; one of the biggest data centers. Sabey Corp. re-purchased &#10;the 1.35 million&#10; square-foot Intergate East facility last September from &#10;Boeing Space &amp;&#10; Defense. In less than 12 months, the developer has leased &#10;92 percent of the&#10; six-building complex to seven different co-location &#10;companies. &#10;&#10; &quot;It is probably the largest data center park in the &#10;country,&quot; boasts Laurent&#10; Poole, chief operating officer at Sabey. Exodus, ICG &#10;Communications,&#10; NetStream Communications, Pac West Telecomm and Zama &#10;Networks all&#10; lease space in the office park. &#10;&#10; After building Exodus&apos; first Tukwila facility in 1997, &#10;Sabey has become an&#10; expert in the arena and now has facilities either under &#10;management or&#10; development in Los Angeles, Spokane and Denver. Poole &#10;claims his firm is&#10; one of the top four builders of Internet data centers in &#10;the country. &#10;&#10; As more people access the Internet and conduct &#10;bandwidth-heavy tasks&#10; such as listening to online music, Poole said the need for &#10;co-location space in&#10; Seattle continues to escalate. &#10;&#10; But it is not just Seattle. The need for data center &#10;space is growing at a&#10; rapid clip at many technology hubs throughout the country, &#10;causing similar&#10; concerns among utilities in places such as Texas and &#10;California. &#10;&#10; Exodus, one of the largest providers of co-location &#10;space, plans to nearly&#10; double the amount of space it has by the end of the year. &#10;While companies&#10; such as Amazon.com run their own server farms, many &#10;high-tech companies&#10; have decided to outsource the operations to companies such &#10;as Exodus that&#10; may be better prepared for dealing with Internet traffic &#10;management. &#10;&#10; &quot;We have 2 million square feet of space under &#10;construction and we plan to&#10; double our size in the next nine months , yet there is more &#10;demand right now&#10; than data center space,&quot; said Steve Porter, an account &#10;executive at Exodus in&#10; Seattle. &#10;&#10; The booming market for co-location space has left some &#10;in the local utility&#10; industry perplexed. &#10;&#10; &quot;It accelerates in a quantum way what you have to do &#10;to serve the growth,&quot;&#10; said Seattle City Light&apos;s Royer. &quot;The utility industry is &#10;almost stunned by this, in&#10; a way.&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of .81 vs &#10;actual of .79&#10; 2. Perceived index was 4.95 vs actual of 4.91&#10; 3. Socal Gas Daily Swaps are trading at a significant premium.&#10;&#10; Aug. 1. The basis market anticipated a Socal/San Juan spread of 1.04 vs &#10;actual of .99&#10; 2.

See if you can add &#10;these modifications:&#10;&#10; 1. Use a formula in column E. Add the value in column C to column D. It &#10;should read =c6+d6. Then copy this formula to the rows below.&#10;&#10; 2. Column H needs a formula. Subtract amount paid from amount owed. &#10;=e6-g6.&#10;&#10; 3. Column F is filled with the #### sign. this is because the column width &#10;is too narrow. Use you mouse to click on the line beside the &#10; letter F. Hold the left mouse button down and drag the column wider.&#10;&#10; 4.

Now that we have had several traders &#10;managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss &#10;any issues you have with the way the model works. I have asked Zimin Lu &#10;(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they &#10;will be available to answer any technical questions. The point of this &#10;meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is &#10;comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those &#10;who are managing the books believe in the model&apos;s results. Since I have &#10;heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to &#10;discuss them.&#10;&#10;Please let me know if you are unable to attend.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Please read the following memo sent to you a few days &#10;ago and if you have any questions regarding this request, please feel free to &#10;call Ted Bland @ 3-5275.&#10;&#10;With Enron&apos;s rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees &#10;between operating companies and new ventures. To do this it is essential to &#10;have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee &#10;data. In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the &#10;year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the Enron VP/MD PRC &#10;requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their &#10;profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education &#10;need to be completed via the HR Global Information System. HRGIS is &#10;accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet. Just go to &#10;hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link. Or just type eglobal.enron.com &#10;on the command line of your browser.&#10;&#10;The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July. If you would &#10;like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned &#10;for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please &#10;contact Kathy Schultea at x33841. &#10;&#10;Your timely response to this request is greatly appreciated. &#10;&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;&#10;Dave</body></mail>

I think &#10;I know the answer to your questions but I want to get the exact details from &#10;him. Basically, they will offer energy online at a fixed price or some &#10;price that undercuts the current provider. Then once their sales are large &#10;enough they will go to the wholesale market to hedge and lock in a profit. &#10;The risk is that they have built in enough margin to give them room to manage &#10;the price risk.

The &#10;WSCC data, which is dicey and we don&apos;t have until July 1999, and the CEMMS, &#10;which comes on a delay, are ultimately our best sources. For your purposes &#10;the CAISO may suffice. I think that you probably know this already, but &#10;there can be a siginificant difference between &quot;scheduled&quot; and &quot;actual&quot; &#10;generation. You are pulling &quot;scheduled.&quot; If someone doesn&apos;t schedule their &#10;generation and then generates, either instructed or uninstructed, then you &#10;will miss that. You may also miss generation of the northern california &#10;munis such as smud who only schedule their net load to the caiso. That is, &#10;if they have 1500 MW of load and 1200 MW of generation, they may simply &#10;schedule 300 MW of load and sc transfers or imports of 300 MW. Having said &#10;all of that, it is probably close enough and better than your alternatives on &#10;the generation side.&#10;&#10;On the load side I think that I would simply use CAISO actual load. While &#10;they don&apos;t split out NP15 from SP15, I think that using the actual number is &#10;better than the &quot;scheduled&quot; number. The utilities play lots of game on the &#10;load side, usually under-scheduling depending on price.&#10;&#10;I think the presentation looks good. It would be useful to share this with &#10;others up here once you have it finished. I&apos;d like to see how much gas &#10;demand goes up with each additional GW of gas-generated electricity, &#10;especially compared to all gas consumption. I was surprised by how small the &#10;UEG consumption was compared to other uses. If it is the largest marginal &#10;consumer then it is obviously a different story.&#10;&#10;Let&apos;s talk.&#10;</body></mail>

Remember that I do not know the Northwest at all, so this may not be &#10;an issue, but I&apos;ll point it out and let you decide. Let me know if this is &#10;O.K. as is, so I&apos;ll know to ignore it in the future. Also, if you want me to &#10;get with Kim and the Sitara people to change the mapping, let me know and &#10;I&apos;ll take care of it..&#10;&#10;On PG&amp;E NW, it appears that PGEN Kingsgate is mapped to a Malin Citygate &#10;curve instead of a Kingsgate curve, resulting in a total transport loss of &#10;$235,019. &#10;(If the mapping were changed, it should just reallocate p&amp;l--not change your &#10;overall p&amp;l.) Maybe there is a reason for this mapping or maybe it affects &#10;something else somewhere that I am not seeing, but anyway, here are the Deal &#10;#&apos;s, paths and p&amp;l impacts of each.&#10; 139195 From Kingsgate to Malin ($182,030)&#10; 139196 From Kingsgate to PGEN/Tuscarora ($ 4,024)&#10; 139197 From Kingsgate to PGEN Malin ($ 8,271)&#10; 231321 From Kingsgate to Malin ($ 38,705)&#10; 153771 From Kingsgate to Stanfield ($ 1,988)&#10; Suggested fix: Change PGEN Kingsgate mapping from GDP-Malin Citygate to &#10;GDP-Kingsgate.&#10;&#10; Clay Basin storage--this is really a FYI more than anything else--I see five &#10;different tickets in Sitara for Clay Basin activity--one appears to be for &#10;withdrawals and the other four are injections. Clay Basin is valued as a &#10;Questar curve, which is substantially below NWPL points. What this means is &#10;that any time you are injecting gas, these tickets will show transport &#10;losses; each time you are withdrawing, you will show big gains on transport. &#10;I&apos;m not sure of the best way to handle this since we don&apos;t really have a &#10;systematic Sitara way of handling storage deals. In an ideal world, it seems &#10;that you would map it the way you have it today, but during injection times, &#10;the transport cost would pass through as storage costs. Anyway, here&apos;s the &#10;detail on the tickets just for your info, plus I noticed three days where it &#10;appears we were both withdrawing and injecting from Clay Basin. There may be &#10;an operational reason why this occurred that I&apos;m not aware of, and the dollar &#10;impact is very small, but I thought I&apos;d bring it to your attention just in &#10;case there&apos;s something you want to do about it. The columns below show the &#10;volumes under each ticket and the p&amp;L associated with each. &#10; &#10;Deal # 251327 159540 265229 &#10;106300 201756&#10;P&amp;L $29,503 ($15,960) ($3,199) &#10;($2,769) ($273)&#10;Rec: Ques/Clay Basin/0184 NWPL/Opal 543 NWPL/Opal Sumas NWPL/S of &#10;Gr Rvr&#10;Del: NWPL/S of Green River/Clay Ques/Clay Basin/0852 Ques/Clay &#10;Basin/0852 Ques/Clay Basin Ques/Clay Basin&#10;1 329 8,738&#10;2 1,500&#10;3 2,974 11,362&#10;4 6,741 12,349 1,439&#10;5 19,052 3,183&#10;9 333&#10;13 30,863 2,680&#10;14 30,451 &#10;15 35,226 &#10;16 6,979 235 &#10;17 17,464 &#10;18 9,294 &#10;20 10,796 771&#10;21 17,930 &#10;22 10,667 &#10;23 14,415 9,076&#10;25 23,934 8,695&#10;26 3,284 &#10;27 1,976&#10;28 1,751 &#10;29 1,591 &#10;30 20,242 &#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

In preparation for that meeting we would like to &#10;gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. &#10;Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are &#10;typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? &#10;How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main &#10;contacts at SW Gas?&#10;&#10;We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our &#10;control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably &#10;have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the &#10;commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their &#10;commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) &#10;should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month &#10;index may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk. That &#10;risk may not be acceptable to the desk. I will do some investigation of &#10;their PGA&apos;s and see if there is an opportunity.&#10;&#10;As to the asset management: do you have any preference on structure? Are &#10;there elements that you would like to see? Any ideas at all would be greatly &#10;appreciated.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Laird&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

The book&#10;covers ancient kilns, and ties it all to modern uses of cement and concrete.&#10;&#10;I find it almost impossible to put down - as the writing flows easily -&#10;interesting, entertaining, and enlightening. David Moore spent over 10 years&#10;learning just how the Romans were able to construct large buildings,&#10;structures, etc., with simply lime and volcanic ash - structures that have&#10;lasted over 2000 years. A great testimonial to the Roman builders; and good&#10;background information for sustainable builder folks.&#10;&#10;Thank you, Mr. Moore. I highly recommend the site and especially the Book.&#10;&#10; &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.romanconcrete.com/&quot;&gt;Roman Concrete Research by David&#10;Moore&lt;/A&gt;&#10;&#10;&#10;Regards,&#10;&#10;Harry Francis</body></mail>

Our&#10;project&#10;&gt; is rather large 2900 sq ft SB house with 1800 sq ft porch surrounding it.&#10;Lot&apos;s&#10;&gt; of cement approx. 160 sq yds. After looking at the costs we changed our&#10;minds&#10;&gt; rather quickly.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Labor for Stamping Crew $2500.00&#10;&gt; Davis Color Stain 4lbs per yd x 100 yds x $18 lb $7200.00&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; These are above and beyond the cost of the concrete.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Actual Result: Took a truck and trailer to Mexico and handpicked Sautillo&#10;tiles&#10;&gt; for inside the house. Changed the color of the cement on the porch to 1lb&#10;per yd&#10;&gt; mix color, added the overrun tiles we had left over as stringers in the&#10;porch&#10;&gt; and accented with acid etched stain.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Tiles and Transportation $3000.00&#10;&gt; Labor, mastic and beer. tile setting (did it myself) $1400.00&#10;&gt; Acid Stain for porch $ 350.00&#10;&gt; Davis Pigment $15 x 40 yds $ 600.00&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; I can get you the info on the stain if you like, I ordered it from a&#10;company the&#10;&gt; web, can&apos;t remember off hand who. I ordered a sample kit for $35.00 which&#10;has 7&#10;&gt; colors you can mix and match for the results you want. It was easy to work&#10;with&#10;&gt; much like painting in water colors on a large scale.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Hope this helps you out,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Matt Kizziah&#10;&gt;</body></mail>

Los Angeles, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Most Western U.S.&#10;spot power prices for delivery tomorrow slumped as supply&#10;outstripped demand.&#10; At the SP-15 delivery point in Southern California, peak&#10;power dropped $186.88 to a Bloomberg index of $205.00 a megawatt-&#10;hour, amid trades in the $175.00-$225.00 range.&#10; &quot;Air conditioning load is diminishing, which is causing&#10;prices to decline,&quot; said one Southwest trader.&#10; According to Weather Services Corp., of Lexington&#10;Massachusetts, temperatures in Los Angeles were expected to reach&#10;75 degrees Fahrenheit today and a low of 59 degrees tonight.&#10; At the Palo Verde switchyard in Arizona, peak power sank&#10;$202.02, or 47.82 percent, to a Bloomberg index of $220.48 as&#10;traders executed transactions in the $210.00-$240.00 range.&#10; Traders said that Arizona&apos;s Public Service Co. 1,270-megawatt&#10;Palo Verde-1 nuclear plant in Wintersburg, Arizona, increased&#10;production to 19 percent of capacity following the completion of a&#10;scheduled refueling outage that began March 31.&#10; At the Mid-Columbia trading point in Washington, peak power&#10;slumped 47.5 percent from Friday&apos;s Sunday-Monday package to a&#10;Bloomberg index of $205.40, with trades at $175.00-$225.00.&#10; According to Belton, Missouri-based Weather Derivatives Inc.,&#10;temperatures in the Pacific Northwest will average 1.2 degrees&#10;Fahrenheit above normal over the next seven days, with cooling&#10;demand 84 percent below normal.&#10; &quot;We are expecting rain in the Pacific Northwest which is&#10;causing temperatures to drop,&quot; said one Northwest trader.&#10; At the NP-15 delivery point in Northern California, peak&#10;power fell $189.39 to a Bloomberg index of $207.75, with trades at&#10;$175.00-$228.00.&#10; According the California Independent System Operator today&apos;s&#10;forecast demand was estimated at 30,827 megawatts, declining 743&#10;megawatts tomorrow to 30,084 megawatts.&#10;&#10;-Robert Scalabrino&#10;&#10;&#10;Northeast Power Prices Fall With More Generation, Less Demand&#10;&#10; Philadelphia, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- An increase in&#10;available generation coupled with less weather-related demand,&#10;caused next-day power prices in the Northeast U.S. to fall as much&#10;as 11.3 percent this morning, traders said.&#10; According to Weather Derivatives Corp. of Belton, Missouri,&#10;temperatures in the Northeast will average within one degree&#10;Fahrenheit of normal over the next seven days, keeping heating and&#10;cooling demand 88 and 96 percent below normal, respectively.&#10; In the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, peak&#10;power scheduled for Tuesday delivery was assessed at a Bloomberg&#10;volume-weighted index of $35.97 per megawatt hour, down $5.48 from&#10;Friday.&#10; &quot;There&apos;s just no weather out there,&quot; said one PJM-based&#10;trader. &quot;There&apos;s no need for air conditioning, and no need for&#10;heating. As far as I can tell, it&apos;s going to be that way all week&#10;long.&quot;&#10; Peak loads in PJM are projected to average less than 30,000&#10;megawatts through Friday.&#10; Traders also cited increased regional capacity as a cause for&#10;the dip. Interconnection data shows 1,675 megawatts returned to&#10;service today, and an additional 1,232 megawatts are expected to&#10;hit the grid tomorrow.&#10; Next-day prices fell across all three zones of the New York&#10;Power Pool, with increased output at the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2&#10;nuclear power facilities.&#10; The Nuclear Regulator Commission reported Nine Mile Point 1&#10;at 90 percent of its 609-megawatt capacity following completion of&#10;a refueling outage, and the 1,148-megawatt Nine Mile Point 2 at&#10;full power following unplanned maintenance. Both units are owned&#10;and operated by Niagara Mohawk.&#10; Zone J, which comprises New York City, slipped $4.50 to&#10;$58.50, while Zones G and A fell $3.25 and $5.50, respectively, to&#10;$51.25 and $40.00 indices.&#10; ~&#10;-Karyn Rispoli&#10;&#10;&#10;Weather-Related Demand Drives Mid-Continent Power Prices Up&#10;&#10; Cincinnati, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Day-ahead peak&#10;power prices rose today in the Mid-Continent U.S. as high&#10;weather-related demand was expected in the Midwest and Southeast,&#10;traders said.&#10; &quot;It&apos;s supposed to be pretty warm in the TVA (Tennessee&#10;Valley Authority) area, so everyone is looking to go from Cinergy&#10;to there,&quot; one East Central Area Reliability Council trader said.&#10;&quot;Dailies and the bal(ance of) week are both stronger because of&#10;that.&quot;&#10; The Bloomberg index price for peak parcels delivered Tuesday&#10;into the Cincinnati-based Cinergy Corp. transmission system rose&#10;$3.52 to $31.17 a megawatt-hour, with trades ranging from $29.25&#10;when the market opened up to $35.00 after options expired.&#10; Cinergy power for Wednesday-Friday delivery sold at $39.00&#10;and power for May 21-25 was offered at $45.50 as demand from the&#10;Southeast was expected to remain high into next week.&#10; Next-day power in TVA sold $2.15 higher on average at&#10;$28.00-$37.00, with temperatures in Nashville, Tennessee,&#10;forecast at 87 degrees Fahrenheit through Thursday.&#10; &quot;Things should continue along these lines for the rest of&#10;the week, because there&apos;s enough power to get down there but not&#10;so much that anyone can flood the market and crush prices,&quot; an&#10;ECAR trader said.&#10; In Mid-America Interconnected Network trading, demand from&#10;the Cinergy hub and the Entergy Corp. grid pulled prices up,&#10;though traders said transmission problems limited volume.&#10; Peak Monday parcels sold $2.25 higher on average at the&#10;Chicago-based Commonwealth Edison hub, trading at $29.50-$34.50,&#10;and $5.50 higher on average in the lower half of the region, with&#10;trades from $32.00-$40.00.&#10; Mid-Continent Area Power Pool peak spot power prices also&#10;climbed today, showing the largest increase in the region as&#10;above-normal temperatures were expected and transmission problems&#10;isolated the market from lower-priced eastern hubs.&#10; For-Tuesday power sold $7.17 higher on average in northern&#10;MAPP at $45.00-$50.00 and $6.56 higher on average in the southern&#10;half of the region at $45.00-$52.00.&#10; Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather Services Corp.&#10;predicted tomorrow&apos;s high temperature would be 85 degrees in&#10;Minneapolis and 91 degrees in Omaha, Nebraska.&#10; &quot;There&apos;s no available transmission from ComEd, and problems&#10;getting power out of Ameren&apos;s grid too,&quot; one MAPP trader said.&#10;&quot;It&apos;s likely to cause problems all week, since it&apos;s hot here and&#10;down in SPP (the Southwest Power Pool).&quot;&#10;&#10;-Ken Fahnestock&#10;&#10;&#10;Southeast Power Prices Mixed as Southern Markets Heat Up&#10;&#10; Atlanta, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- U.S. Southeast spot&#10;electricity prices were mixed today as hot weather returned to&#10;major Southern U.S. population centers, traders said.&#10; Forecasters from Lexington, Massachusetts-based Weather&#10;Services Corp. predicted daily high temperatures in the Atlanta&#10;vicinity would peak tomorrow at 86 degrees Fahrenheit, 5&#10;degrees higher than today&apos;s projected high. Cooler weather is&#10;expected to begin Wednesday.&#10; Conversely, in the Nashville, Tennessee, vicinity,&#10;temperatures will remain in the high-80s to low-90s all week,&#10;propelling air conditioning demand, traders said.&#10; The Bloomberg Southeast Electric Reliability Council&#10;regional index price rose 10 cents a megawatt-hour from&#10;equivalent trades made Friday for delivery today, to $37.20.&#10;Trades ranged from $26.50-$42.50.&#10; On the Tennessee Valley Authority grid, power traded an&#10;average of $2.15 higher at a Bloomberg index of $34.44 amid&#10;trades in the $28.00-$37.00 range.&#10; In Texas, day-ahead power prices rose 84 cents for UB firm&#10;energy to a Bloomberg index of $47.50, though utility traders&#10;complained of slack demand versus the same time in 2000.&#10; &quot;There&apos;s just no overnight load to do anything with the&#10;supply we have,&quot; said one Texas-based utility power trader.&#10;&quot;Last year at this time, we saw a bunch of 93-95 degree&#10;(Fahrenheit) days. This year so far, the highest we&apos;ve seen is&#10;85 degrees, so that&apos;s about 10 degrees below normal for us.&quot;&#10; On the Entergy Corp. grid, day-ahead peak power for&#10;tomorrow opened at $38.50-$42.00, though most trades were done&#10;at a Bloomberg index of $40.25, $1.25 less than Friday. Traders&#10;said forecasts for cooler weather through much of the South&#10;starting Wednesday caused day-ahead prices to trade late at&#10;$35-$36.&#10; Traders said Southern Co. was purchasing day-ahead energy&#10;at $37 from utilities in the Virginia-Carolinas region because&#10;power from VACAR was cheaper than from utilities in SERC.&#10; Southern day-ahead power traded $2 higher at a Bloomberg&#10;index of $37, amid trades in the $35-$39 range.&#10; In the forward power markets, Entergy power for the&#10;balance of this week sold early today at $47.00, though later&#10;trades were noted as high as $48.75. Balance-of-May Entergy&#10;power was bid at $48, though few offers were heard, traders&#10;said.&#10; On the TVA grid, power for the balance of this week was&#10;bid at $40, though the nearest offer was $45. Firm energy for&#10;the balance of May was discussed at $41, though no new trades&#10;were noted.&#10;&#10;-Brian Whary&#10;&#10;&#10;U.K. Power Prices Fall as Offers Continue to Outweigh Bids&#10;&#10; London, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Power prices in the U.K.&#10;fell for the fourth consecutive day amid continued heavy selling&#10;interest, traders said.&#10; Winter 2001 baseload traded as high as 21.52 pounds a&#10;megawatt-hour and as low as 21.35 pounds a megawatt-hour, before&#10;closing at 21.42 pounds a megawatt-hour, 11 pence lower than&#10;Friday.&#10; The contract has fallen around 82 pence since the start of&#10;the month amid aggressive selling interest, mainly from one&#10;trading house, which intended to buy back contracts where it was&#10;short. Volatility in the contract today stemmed from opposition&#10;from another trading house, which bought the contract, supporting&#10;price levels, traders said.&#10; Shorter-term contracts also fell today as warm weather was&#10;expected to curtail heating demand and also amid lower production&#10;costs because of falling natural gas prices, traders said.&#10; June baseload power contracts fell 22 pence from Friday after&#10;last trading at 18.35 pounds a megawatt-hour.&#10; On the International Petroleum Exchange, June natural gas&#10;futures traded 0.31 pence lower today after last trading at 21.15&#10;pence a thermal unit. The contract has fallen by 1.74 pence since&#10;the start of last week.&#10; Some traders, however, remained reluctant to give fundamental&#10;reasons for price movements because of the immaturity of the&#10;market, given the recent launch of the new trading agreements.&#10;Most trading activity was in an effort to find new price levels,&#10;they said.&#10;&#10;-Amal Halawi&#10;&#10;&#10;Nordic Power Soars in Active Trade on Renewed Buying Interest&#10;&#10; Lysaker, Norway, May 14 (Bloomberg Energy) -- Longer-term&#10;electricity prices on the Nordic Power Exchange in Lysaker,&#10;Norway, soared in active afternoon trade after participants rushed&#10;to buy seasonal contracts in an attempt to close positions amid&#10;limited hydro-supply, traders said.&#10; Winter-2 2001 closed 6.00 Norwegian kroner higher at an all&#10;time high of 214.50 kroner a megawatt-hour after a total 603.00&#10;megawatts were exchanged as low as 207.25 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10;Winter-1 2002 jumped 5.65 kroner after discussions ranged 207.50-&#10;214.00 kroner a megawatt-hour.&#10; &quot;The market crash everyone was waiting for never came; now&#10;you have to pay higher prices to develop positions,&apos;&apos; an Oslo-&#10;based trader said. &quot;I&apos;m surprised that even at the peak of the&#10;snow melting season and in anticipation of wet weather, prices are&#10;steadily climbing.&apos;&apos;&#10; Precipitation across Scandinavia was forecast at 200 percent&#10;above normal for the next 10 days, according to U.S. forecasters.&#10;Still, another trader said 170 percent above normal was a &quot;more&#10;realistic expectation following recent over-estimation of wet&#10;outlooks.&apos;&apos;&#10; Tuesday&apos;s system area average price was set below expecations&#10;of 195.00 kroner a megawatt-hour at 185.70 kroner a megawatt-hour,&#10;down 7.45 kroner from today&apos;s price. Still, traders said this was&#10;a &quot;high&apos;&apos; spot price for this time of the year.&#10; Week 21 closed down 1 kroner at 189 kroner a megawatt-hour&#10;with 140 megawatts exchanged.&#10; Trade volumes on Nordpool totalled 5,469 gigawatt-hours&#10;generation, up 368 percent from Friday&apos;s 1,169 gigawatt-hours.&#10;&#10;-Alejandro Barbajosa&#10;-0- (BES) May/14/2001 19:33 GMT&#10;=0F$&#10;&#10;&#10; - daily.pdf</body></mail>

Any possibility for a &#10;deal has reportedly fallen apart. According to sources, both the Republicans &#10;and Democratic caucuses are turning against Davis. The Democratic caucus is &#10;reportedly &quot;unwilling to fight&quot; for Davis. Many legislative Republicans and &#10;Democrats reportedly do not trust Davis and express concern that, once the &#10;bonds are issued to replenish the General Fund, Davis would &quot;double dip&quot; into &#10;the fund. Clearly there is a lack of good faith between the legislature and &#10;the governor. However, it is believed once Davis discloses the details of &#10;the power contracts negotiated, a bond issuance will take place. &#10;Additionally, some generator sources have reported that some of the long-term &#10;power contracts (as opposed to those still in development) require that the &#10;bond issuance happen by July 1, 2001. If not, the state may be in breach of &#10;contract. Sources state that if the legislature does not pass the bridge &#10;loan legislation by May 8th, having a bond issuance by July 1st will be very &#10;difficult.&#10;&#10;The Republicans were planning to offer an alternative plan whereby the state &#10;would &quot;eat&quot; the $5 billion cost of power spent to date out of the General &#10;Fund, thereby decreasing the amount of the bond issuance to approximately $8 &#10;billion. However, the reportedly now are not going to offer even this &#10;concession. Sources report that the Republicans intend to hold out for full &#10;disclosure of the governor&apos;s plan for handling the crisis, including the &#10;details and terms of all long-term contracts he has negotiated, before they &#10;will support the bond issuance to go forward.&#10;&#10;Currently there are two bills dealing with the bridge loan; AB 8X and AB &#10;31X. AB 8X authorizes the DWR to sell up to $10 billion in bonds. This bill &#10;passed the Senate in March, but has stalled in the Assembly due to a lack of &#10;Republican support. AB 31X deals with energy conservation programs for &#10;community college districts. However, sources report this bill may be &#10;amended to include language relevant to the bond sale by Senator Bowen, &#10;currently in AB 8X. Senator Bowen&apos;s language states that the state should &#10;get paid before the utilities from rate payments (which, if passed, would be &#10;likely to cause a SoCal bankruptcy). &#10; &#10;According to sources close to the Republicans in the legislature, &#10;Republicans do not believe there should be a bridge loan due to money &#10;available in the General Fund. For instance, Tony Strickland has stated &#10;that only 1/2 of the bonds (or approximately $5 billion) should be issued. &#10;Other Republicans reportedly do not support issuing any bonds. The &#10;Republicans intend to bring this up in debate on Monday. Additionally, &#10;Lehman Brothers reportedly also feels that a bridge loan is unnecessary and &#10;there are some indications that Lehman may back out of the bridge loan.&#10; &#10;Key Points of the Bridge Financing&#10;Initial Loan Amount: $4.125 B&#10;Lenders: JP Morgan $2.5 B&#10; Lehman Brothers $1.0 B&#10; Bear Stearns $625 M&#10;Tax Exempt Portion: Of the $4.125 B; $1.6 B is expected to be tax-exempt&#10;Projected Interest Rate: Taxable Rate 5.77%&#10; Tax-Exempt Rate 4.77%&#10;Current Projected &#10;Blended IR: 5.38%&#10;Maturity Date: August 29, 2001&#10;For more details please contact me at (713) 853-9510&#10;&#10;Bill SB 6X Passed the Senate Yesterday, but Little Can be Done at This Time&#10;The Senate passed SB 6X yesterday, which authorizes $5 billion to create the &#10;California Consumer Power and Conservation Authority. The $5 billion &#10;authorized under SB 6X is not the same as the $5 billion that must be &#10;authorized by the legislature to pay for power already purchased, or the &#10;additional amount of bonds that must be authorized to pay for purchasing &#10;power going forward. Again, the Republicans are not in support of these &#10;authorizations. Without the details of the long-term power contracts the &#10;governor has negotiated, the Republicans do not know what the final bond &#10;amount is that must be issued and that taxpayers will have to pay to &#10;support. No further action can be taken regarding the implementation of SB &#10;6X until it is clarified how and when the state and the utilities get paid &#10;for purchasing power. Also, there is no staff, defined purpose, etc. for &#10;the California Public Power and Conservation Authority. However, this can &#10;be considered a victory for consumer advocates, who began promoting this &#10;idea earlier in the crisis.&#10; &#10;SoCal Edison and Bankruptcy&#10;At this point, two events would be likely to trigger a SoCal bankruptcy. The &#10;first would be a legislative rejection of the MOU between SoCal and the &#10;governor. The specified deadline for legislative approval of the MOU is &#10;August 15th, however, some decision will likely be made earlier. According &#10;to sources, the state has yet to sign the MOU with SoCal, though SoCal has &#10;signed it. The Republicans are against the MOU in its current form and Davis &#10;and the Senate lack the votes needed to pass. If the legislature indicates &#10;that it will not pas the MOU, SoCal would likely file for voluntary &#10;bankruptcy (or its creditor - involuntary) due to the lack operating cash. &#10;&#10;The second likely triggering event, which is linked directly to the bond &#10;issuance, would be an effort by Senator Bowen to amend SB 31X (bridge loan) &#10;stating that the DWR would received 100% of its payments from ratepayers, &#10;then the utilities would receive the residual amount. In other words, the &#10;state will get paid before the utilities. If this language is included and &#10;passed by the legislature, it appears likely that SoCal will likely file for &#10;bankruptcy. SoCal is urging the legislature to pay both the utilities and &#10;the DWR proportionately from rate payments.&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

I would suggest holding &#10;the business plan meetings here then take a trip without any formal business &#10;meetings. I would even try and get some honest opinions on whether a trip is &#10;even desired or necessary.&#10;&#10;As far as the business meetings, I think it would be more productive to try &#10;and stimulate discussions across the different groups about what is working &#10;and what is not. Too often the presenter speaks and the others are quiet &#10;just waiting for their turn. The meetings might be better if held in a &#10;round table discussion format. &#10;&#10;My suggestion for where to go is Austin. Play golf and rent a ski boat and &#10;jet ski&apos;s. Flying somewhere takes too much time.&#10;</body></mail>

The following assumptions were made &#10;to establish our bid: 5% daily injection capacity, 10% daily withdrawal &#10;capacity, 1% fuel (injection only), 0.01/MMBtu variable injection and &#10;withdrawal fees. Also an undiscounted June 01 to January 02 spread of $0.60 &#10;existed at the time of this bid.&#10;&#10;Bid for a 1 year storage contract beginning June 01 based on above &#10;assumptions: $0.05/ MMBtu/Month ($0.60/Year).

Never say never, but I think it is highly unlikely that &#10;the final order will contain a fixed price cap. I base this belief in large &#10;part on what I heard at a luncheon I attended yesterday afternoon at which &#10;the keynote speaker was FERC Chairman Curt Hebert. Although the Chairman &#10;began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or &#10;answer questions on pending proceedings before the Commission, Hebert had &#10;some enlightening comments which relate to price caps:&#10;&#10;Price caps are almost never the right answer&#10;Price Caps will have the effect of prolonging shortages&#10;Competitive choices for consumers is the right answer&#10;Any solution, however short term, that does not increase supply or reduce &#10;demand, is not acceptable&#10;Eight out of eleven western Governors oppose price caps, in that they would &#10;export California&apos;s problems to the West&#10;&#10;This is the latest intelligence I have on the matter, and it&apos;s a pretty &#10;strong anti- price cap position. Of course, Hebert is just one Commissioner &#10;out of 3 currently on the Commission, but he controls the meeting agenda and &#10;if the draft order is not to his liking, the item could be bumped off the &#10;agenda. Hope this info helps.

Your intuition as to reductions seen so far (e.g., March 2001 vs. &#10;March 2000) was absolutely correct. At this point, it appears that demand &#10;over the last 12 months in the CAISO control area, after adjusting for &#10;temperature and time of use factors, has fallen by about 6%. This translates &#10;into a reduction of about 1,500-1,600 MWa for last month (March 2001) as &#10;compared with the previous year.&#10;&#10;Looking forward into the summer, I believe that we will see further voluntary &#10;reductions (as opposed to &quot;forced&quot; reductions via rolling blackouts). Other &#10;forecasters (e.g., PIRA) are estimating that another 1,200-1,300 MWa (making &#10;total year-on-year reduction = 2,700-2,800) will come off starting in June. &#10;This scenario is not difficult to imagine, as it would require only a couple &#10;more percentage points reduction in overall peak demand. Given that the 6% &#10;decrease we have seen so far has come without any real price signals to the &#10;retail market, and that rates are now scheduled to increase, I think that it &#10;is possible we could see peak demand fall by as much as 10% relative to last &#10;year. This would mean peak demand reductions of approx 3,300-3,500 MWa in &#10;Jun-Aug. In addition, a number of efforts aimed specifically at conservation &#10;are being promoted by the State, which can only increase the likelihood of &#10;meeting, and perhaps exceeding, the 3,500 MWa figure. Finally, the general &#10;economic slowdown in Calif could also further depress demand, or at least &#10;make the 3,500 MWa number that much more attainable.&#10;&#10;Note that all the numbers I am reporting here are for the CAISO control area &#10;only, which represents about 89% of total Calif load, or 36-37% of WSCC &#10;(U.S.) summer load. I think it is reasonable to assume that the non-ISO &#10;portion of Calif (i.e., LADWP and IID) will see similar reductions in &#10;demand. As for the rest of the WSCC, that is a much more difficult call. As &#10;you are aware, the Pacific NW has already seen about 2,000 MWa of aluminum &#10;smelter load come off since Dec, and this load is expected to stay off at &#10;least through Sep, and possibly for the next couple of years (if BPA gets its &#10;wish). This figure represents approx 4% of the non-Calif WSCC. Several &#10;mining operations in the SW and Rockies have recently announced that they are &#10;sharply curtailing production. I have not yet been able to pin down exactly &#10;how many MW this translates to, but I will continue to research the issue. &#10;Other large industrials may follow suit, and the ripple effects from Calif&apos;s &#10;economic slowdown could be a factor throughout the West. While the rest of &#10;the WSCC may not see the 10%+ reductions that I am expecting in Calif, I &#10;think we could easily expect an additional 2-3% (on top of the 4% already &#10;realized), or approx 1,000-1,500 MWa, of further demand reduction in the &#10;non-Calif WSCC for this summer. This would bring the total reduction for the &#10;WSCC, including the 2,000 MWa aluminum load we have already seen, to around &#10;6,500-7,000 MWa when compared with last summer.&#10;&#10;I am continuing to research and monitor the situation, and will provide you &#10;with updates as new or better information becomes available. Meantime, I &#10;hope this helps. Please feel free to call (503-464-8671) if you have any &#10;questions or need any further information.&#10;</body></mail>

However, my closing has been postponed. As I mentioned &#10;I am going to have Cary Kipp draw the plans for the residence and I will get &#10;back in touch with you once he is finished.&#10;&#10;Regarding the multifamily project, I am going to work with a project manager &#10;from San Antonio. For my first development project, I feel more comfortable &#10;with their experience obtaining FHA financing. We are working with Kipp &#10;Flores to finalize the floor plans and begin construction drawings. Your bid &#10;for the construction is competive with other construction estimates. I am &#10;still attracted to your firm as the possible builder due to your strong local &#10;relationships. I will get back in touch with you once we have made the final &#10;determination on unit mix and site plan.&#10;&#10;Phillip Allen</body></mail>

I think you are right that engaging an architect is &#10;the next logical step. I had already contacted Cary Kipp and sent him the &#10;floor plan.&#10;He got back to me yesterday with his first draft. He took my plan and &#10;improved it. I am going to officially engage Cary to draw the plans. While &#10;he works on those I wanted to try and work out a detailed specification &#10;list. Also, I would like to visit a couple of homes that you have built and &#10;speak to 1 or 2 satisfied home owners. I will be in San Marcos on Friday &#10;April 13th. Are there any homes near completion that I could walk through &#10;that day?

Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.&#10;&#10;Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new &#10;building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being &#10;offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.&#10;&#10;This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the &#10;new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The &#10;cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is &#10;currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly &#10;employee cost of $94.00.&#10;&#10;If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to &#10;the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made &#10;as spaces become available. &#10;&#10;The Saturn Ring that connects the garage and both buildings will not be &#10;opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street &#10;level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. &#10;Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an &#10;exit in the event of elevator trouble. &#10;&#10;If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to &#10;Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your &#10;email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and &#10;receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new &#10;garage.&#10;&#10;The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and &#10;Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060 with any questions. &#10;&#10;(You must enter &amp; exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, &#10;will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell &amp; Smith.)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Any experience with FHA &#10;221(d) loans? &#10;&#10;Although your fees are lower than George and Larry I am still getting market &#10;quotes lower yet. I have received estimates structured as follows:&#10;&#10; 5% - onsite expenses, supervision, clean up, equipment&#10; 2%- overhead&#10; 4%- profit&#10;&#10;I just wanted to give you this initial feedback. I have also attached an &#10;extremely primitive spreadsheet to outline the project. As you can see even &#10;reducing the builders fees to the numbers above the project would only &#10;generate $219,194 of cash flow for a return of 21%. I am not thrilled about &#10;such a low return. I think I need to find a way to get the total cost down &#10;to $10,500,000 which would boost the return to 31%. Any ideas?&#10;&#10;I realize that you are offering significant development experience plus you &#10;local connections. I am not discounting those services. I will be out of &#10;the office for the rest of the week, but I will call you early next week.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Below is a &#10;list of questions on the specs:&#10;&#10;1. Is the framing Lumber #2 yellow pine? Wouldn&apos;t fir or spruce warp less &#10;and cost about the same?&#10;&#10;2. What type of floor joist would be used? 2x12 or some sort of factory &#10;joist?&#10;&#10;3. What type for roof framing? On site built rafters? or engineered trusses?&#10;&#10;4. Are you planning for insulation between floors to dampen sound? What &#10;type of insulation in floors and ceiling? Batts or blown? Fiberglass or &#10;Cellulose?&#10;&#10;5. Any ridge venting or other vents (power or turbine)?&#10;&#10;6. Did you bid for interior windows to have trim on 4 sides? I didn&apos;t know &#10;the difference between an apron and a stool.&#10;&#10;7. Do you do anything special under the upstairs tile floors to prevent &#10;cracking? Double plywood or hardi board underlay?&#10;&#10;8. On the stairs, did you allow for a bannister? I was thinking a partial &#10;one out of iron. Only about 5 feet.&#10;&#10;9. I did not label it on the plan, but I was intending for a 1/2 bath under &#10;the stairs. A pedestal sink would probably work.&#10;&#10;10. Are undermount sinks different than drop ins? I was thinking undermount &#10;stainless in kitchen and undermount cast iron in baths.&#10;&#10;11. 1 or 2 A/C units? I am assuming 2.&#10;&#10;12. Prewired for sound indoors and outdoors?&#10;&#10;13. No door and drawer pulls on any cabinets or just bath cabinets?&#10;&#10;14. Exterior porches included in bid? Cedar decking on upstairs? Iron &#10;railings?&#10;&#10;15. What type of construction contract would you use? Fixed price except &#10;for change orders?&#10;&#10;I want to get painfully detailed with the specs before I make a decision but &#10;this is a start. I think I am ready to get plans drawn up. I am going to &#10;call Cary Kipp to&#10;see about setting up a design meeting to see if I like his ideas.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;I&#10;&#10; </body></mail>

You mentioned 2% &#10;overhead, 3 % ???, and 5% profit.&#10;&#10;Why is profit only 4%? &#10;&#10;Why are the architect fees up to $200K. I thought they would be $80K.&#10;&#10;What is the $617K of profit allowance? Is that the developers profit to &#10;boost loan amount but not a real cost?&#10;&#10;Total Closing and Application costs of 350K? That seems very high? Who &#10;receives the 2 points? How much will be sunk costs if FHA declines us?&#10;&#10;Where is your 1%? Are you receiving one of the points on the loan?&#10;&#10;What is the status on the operating pro forma? My back of the envelope puts &#10;NOI at $877K assuming 625/1BR, 1300/3BR, 950/2BR, 5% vacancy, and 40% &#10;expenses. After debt service that would only leave $122K.

Technically, that bank lowered the &#10;loan amount based on lower estimates of rents which altered the amount of &#10;equity that would be required. &#10;&#10;Did I loan them $1,300,000?

Most of these items are &#10;in a state of partial completion by the consultants. I have been speaking &#10;directly to the architect, engineer, and soils engineer. I am unclear on &#10;what is the best way to proceed with these consultants. &#10;&#10;The obligations should include the fees owed to the consultants above.

But sources said Powerex, a subsidiary of British Columbia&#10;Hydro &amp; Power Authority (X.BCH), is the only energy company in the Northwest&#10;region with an abundant supply of electricity to spare and the ISO paid&#10;about $900 a megawatt-hour from the early afternoon through the evening.&#10;But that still wasn&apos;t enough juice.&#10;The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power sold the ISO 1,200 megawatts&#10;of power later in the day at the wholesale electricity price cap rate of&#10;$250/MWh. The LADWP, which is not governed by the ISO, needs 3,800 megawatts&#10;of power to serve its customers. It is free sell power instate above the&#10;$250/MWh price cap.&#10;The LADWP has been very vocal about the amount of power it has to spare. The&#10;municipal utility has also reaped huge profits by selling its excess power&#10;into the grid when supply is tight and prices are high. However, the LADWP&#10;is named as a defendant in a civil lawsuit alleging price gouging. The suit&#10;claims the LADWP sells some of its power it gets from the federal Bonneville&#10;Power Administration, which sells hydropower at cheap rates, back into the&#10;market at prices 10 times higher.&#10;Powerex officials wouldn&apos;t comment on the ISO power sale, saying all&#10;transactions are proprietary. But the company also sold the ISO 1,000&#10;megawatts Tuesday - minutes before the ISO was to declare rolling blackouts&#10;- for $1,100 a megawatt-hour, market sources said.&#10;The ISO, whose main job is to keep electricity flowing throughout the state&#10;no matter what the cost, started the day with a stage-two power emergency,&#10;which means its operating reserves fell to less than 5%. The ISO is having&#10;to compete with investor-owned utilities in the Northwest that are willing&#10;to pay higher prices for power in a region where there are no price caps.&#10;The ISO warned federal regulators, generators and utilities Wednesday during&#10;a conference call that it would call a stage-three power emergency&#10;Wednesday, but wouldn&apos;t order rolling blackouts. A stage three is declared&#10;when the ISO&apos;s operating reserves fall to less than 1.5% and power is&#10;interrupted on a statewide basis to keep the grid from collapsing.&#10;But ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said it would call a stage three only as&#10;a means of attracting additional electricity resources.&#10;&quot;In order to line up (more power) we have to be in a dire situation,&quot;&#10;Dorinson said.&#10;Edison International unit (EIX) Southern California Edison, Sempra Energy&#10;unit (SRE) San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, PG&amp;E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas &amp;&#10;Electric and several municipal utilities in the state will share the cost of&#10;the high-priced power.&#10;SoCal Edison and PG&amp;E are facing a debt of more than $6 billion due to high&#10;wholesale electricity costs. The utilities debt this week could grow by&#10;nearly $1 billion, analysts said. It&apos;s still unclear whether retail&#10;customers will be forced to pay for the debt through higher electricity&#10;rates or if companies will absorb the costs.&#10;-By Jason Leopold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3874;&#10;jason.leopold@dowjones.com&#10;(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00&#10;1318GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc&#10;13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 DJ Calif ISO, PUC Inspect Off-line Duke South Bay&#10;Pwr Plant&#10;(This article was originally published Wednesday)&#10;LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Representatives of the California Independent&#10;System Operator and Public Utilities Commission inspected Duke Energy&#10;Corp.&apos;s (DUK) off-line 700-MW South Bay Power Plant in Chula Vista, Calif.,&#10;Wednesday morning, a Duke spokesman said.&#10;The ISO and PUC have been inspecting all off-line power plants in the state&#10;since Tuesday evening to verify that those plants are shut down for the&#10;reasons generators say they are, ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.&#10;About 11,000 MW of power has been off the state&apos;s power grid since Monday,&#10;7,000 MW of which is off-line for unplanned maintenance, according to the&#10;ISO.&#10;The ISO manages grid reliability.&#10;As previously reported, the ISO told utilities and the Federal Energy&#10;Regulatory Commission Wednesday that it would call a stage three power alert&#10;at 5 PM PST (0100 GMT Thursday), meaning power reserves in the state would&#10;dip below 1.5% and rolling blackouts could be implemented to avoid grid&#10;collapse. However, the ISO said the action wouldn&apos;t result in rolling&#10;blackouts.&#10;The ISO and PUC also inspected Tuesday plants owned by Dynegy Inc (DYN),&#10;Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and Southern Energy Inc (SOE).&#10;Duke&apos;s 1,500-MW Moss Landing plant was also inspected by PUC representatives&#10;in June, when some units were off-line for repairs, the Duke spokesman said.&#10;&#10;&#10; -By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872;&#10;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com&#10;&#10;(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00&#10;1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc&#10;13:17 GMT 7 December 2000 =DJ Calif Regulators Visit AES,Dynegy Off-Line&#10;Power Plants&#10;(This article was originally published Wednesday)&#10;&#10; By Jessica Berthold&#10; Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES&#10;&#10;LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--AES Corp. (AES) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said&#10;Wednesday that representatives of California power officials had stopped by&#10;some of their power plants to verify that they were off line for legitimate&#10;reasons.&#10;The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state&apos;s power&#10;grid and one of its wholesale power markets, and the California Public&#10;Utilities Commission began on-site inspections Tuesday night of all power&#10;plants in the state reporting that unplanned outages have forced shutdowns,&#10;ISO spokesman Pat Dorinson said.&#10;The state has had 11,000 MW off the grid since Monday, 7,000 MW for&#10;unplanned maintenance. The ISO Wednesday called a Stage 2 power emergency&#10;for the third consecutive day, meaning power reserves were below 5% and&#10;customers who agreed to cut power in exchange for reduced rates may be&#10;called on to do so.&#10;As reported earlier, Reliant Energy (REI) and Southern Energy Inc. (SOE)&#10;said they had been visited by representatives of the ISO and PUC Tuesday&#10;evening.&#10;Representatives of the two organizations also visited plants owned by AES&#10;and Dynegy Tuesday evening.&#10;AES told the visitors they couldn&apos;t perform an unannounced full inspection&#10;of the company&apos;s 450-megawatt Huntington Beach power station until Wednesday&#10;morning, when the plant&apos;s full staff would be present, AES spokesman Aaron&#10;Thomas said.&#10;Thomas, as well as an ISO spokesman, didn&apos;t know whether the representatives&#10;returned Wednesday for a full inspection.&#10;&#10; AES Units Down Due To Expired Emissions Credits&#10;&#10;The Huntington Beach facility and units at two other AES facilities have&#10;used up their nitrogen oxide, or NOx, emission credits. They were taken down&#10;two weeks ago in response to a request by the South Coast Air Quality&#10;Management District to stay off line until emissions controls are deployed,&#10;Thomas said.&#10;AES has about 2,000 MW, or half its maximum output, off line. The entire&#10;Huntington plant is off line, as is 1,500 MW worth of units at its Alamitos&#10;and Redondo Beach plants.&#10;The ISO has asked AES to return its off line plants to operations, but AES&#10;has refused because it is concerned the air quality district will fine the&#10;company $20 million for polluting.&#10;&quot;We&apos;d be happy to put our units back, provided we don&apos;t get sued for it,&quot;&#10;Thomas said. &quot;It&apos;s not clear to us that the ISO trumps the air quality&#10;district&apos;s&quot; authority.&#10;As reported, a spokesman for the air quality district said Tuesday that AES&#10;could have elected to buy more emission credits so that it could run its off&#10;line plants in case of power emergencies, but choose not to do so.&#10;&#10; Dynegy&apos;s El Segundo Plant Also Visited By PUC&#10;&#10;Dynegy Inc. (DYN) said the PUC visited its 1,200 MW El Segundo plant Tuesday&#10;evening, where two of the four units, about 600 MW worth, were off line&#10;Wednesday.&#10;&quot;I guess our position is, &apos;Gee, we&apos;re sorry you don&apos;t believe us, but if you&#10;need to come and take a look for yourself, that&apos;s fine,&apos;&quot; said Dynegy&#10;spokesman Lynn Lednicky.&#10;Lednicky said one of the two units was off line for planned maintenance and&#10;the other for unplanned maintenance on boiler feedwater pumps, which could&#10;pose a safety hazard if not repaired.&#10;&quot;We&apos;ve been doing all we can to get back in service,&quot; Lednicky said. &quot;We&#10;even paid to have some specialized equipment expedited.&quot;&#10;Lednicky added that the PUC seemed satisfied with Dynegy&apos;s explanation of&#10;why its units were off line.&#10;-By Jessica Berthold, Dow Jones Newswires; 323-658-3872,&#10;jessica.berthold@dowjones.com&#10;(END) Dow Jones Newswires 07-12-00&#10;1317GMT Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones &amp; Company Inc&#10;&#10;&#10;G_nther A.

According to BPA,&#10;it had excess energy to sell as a result of running water to meet&#10;biological opinion flow standards, but it has stopped doing so in&#10;order to allow reservoirs to fill from runoff. The agency said it had&#10;been telling California&apos;s Department of Water Resources that the&#10;sales could cease at any time, and this morning they ended.&#10;&#10;Cal-ISO reported about 1,600 MW less imports today than&#10;yesterday, so it appears other sellers have also cut back.&#10;Yesterday, PowerEx said it was not selling into California because&#10;of concerns about its water reserves. BPA said it is still sending&#10;exchange energy into California, however.&#10;&#10;More details, if available, will be included in the Friday edition of the&#10;Western Price Survey and in California Energy Markets newsletter.&#10;</body></mail>

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which &#10;current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.&#10;&#10;Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this &#10;project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design &#10;and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of &#10;our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or &#10;rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? &#10;&#10;Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a &#10;percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on &#10;your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, &#10;or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the &#10;second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per &#10;year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these &#10;valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the &#10;forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in &#10;the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future &#10;projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per &#10;month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the &#10;attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings &#10;the total net buyout to $78,946.? &#10;&#10;We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we &#10;offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout &#10;offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are &#10;prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? &#10;If this is your &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, &#10;Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then &#10;draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the &#10;Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout &#10;amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.&#10;&#10;Thank you.&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;Sincerely,&#10;&#10;[IMAGE]&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;George W.

I spoke to Hugo Alexandro at Cuatro Consultants. The property is &#10;still in two parcels. Hugo has completed a platt to combine into one lot &#10;and is ready to submit it to the city of San Marcos. He has also completed a &#10;topographical survey and a tree survey. In addition, he has begun to &#10;coordinate with the city on the replatting and a couple of easements on the &#10;smaller parcel, as well as, beginning the work on the grading. Hugo is going &#10;to fax me a written letter of the scope of work he has been engaged to &#10;complete. The total cost of his services are estimated at $38,000 of which &#10;$14,000 are due now for work completed. &#10;&#10;We are trying to resolve the issues of outstanding work and bills incurred by &#10;the original developer so we can obtain the title to the land. If we can &#10;continue to use Cuatro then it would be one less point of contention. Hugo&apos;s &#10;number is 512-295-8052. I thought you might want to contact him directly and &#10;ask him some questions. I spoke to him about the possibility of your call &#10;and he was fine with that. &#10;&#10;Now we are going to try and determine if any of the work performed by Kipp &#10;Flores can be used.&#10;&#10;Keith and I appreciate you meeting with us on Sunday.

Keith and I think this is a joke. &#10;&#10;We still need to speak to his engineer and find out about his soil study to &#10;determine if it has any value going forward. I don&apos;t believe the architect &#10;work will be of any use to us. I don&apos;t think they deserve any compensation &#10;for their time due to the fact that intentional or not the project they were &#10;proposing was unsupportable by the market. &#10;&#10;My version of a buyout is attached.&#10;&#10;I need your expert advise. I am ready to offer my version or threaten to &#10;foreclose. Do they have a case that they are due money for their time? &#10;Since their cost&#10;and fees didn&apos;t hold up versus the market and we didn&apos;t execute a contract, I &#10;wouldn&apos;t think they would stand a chance.

The due on these contracts is $61,175, of which &#10;current unpaid invoices due total $37,325.&#10;&#10;Acting in good faith, we have invested an enormous amount of time into this &#10;project for more than five months and have completed most of the major design &#10;and other pre-construction elements.? As it is a major project for a firm of &#10;our size, it was given top priority with other projects being delayed or &#10;rejected, and we are now left with no project to pursue.? &#10;&#10;Two methods for valuing this development management are 1) based on a &#10;percentage of the minimum $1.4MM fee we were to have earned and 2) based on &#10;your prior valuation of our time.? For the first, we feel that at least 25%, &#10;or $350,000, of the minimum $1.4MM fee has been earned to date.? For the &#10;second, in your prior correspondence you valued our time at $500,000 per &#10;year, which would mean this period was worth $208,333.? Either of these &#10;valuations seem quite fair and reasonable, especially as neither includes the &#10;forfeit of our 40% interest in the project worth $0.8--$1.2MM. ?However, in &#10;the hope that we can maintain a good relationship with the prospect of future &#10;projects, we are willing to accept only a small monthly fee of $15,000 per &#10;month to cover a portion of our direct time and overhead.? As shown in the &#10;attached table, this fee, plus cash outlays and less accrued interest brings &#10;the total net buyout to $78,946.? &#10;&#10;We still believe that this project needs the professional services that we &#10;offer and have provided.? However, if you accept the terms of this buyout &#10;offer, which we truly feel is quite fair and reasonable, then, we are &#10;prepared to be bought out and leave this extraordinary project to you both.? &#10;If this is your &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;choice, either contact us, or have your attorney contact our attorney, &#10;Claudia Crocker, no later than Friday of this week.? The attorneys can then &#10;draft whatever minimal documents are necessary for the transfer of the &#10;Bishops Corner, Ltd. Partnership to you following receipt of the buyout &#10;amount and assumption of the outstanding professional design contracts.&#10;&#10;Thank you.&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;Sincerely,&#10;&#10;[IMAGE]&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;?&#10;&#10;George W.

Upon receipt of all the requested information regarding the&#10;project, we completed somewhat of a due diligence on the market. There are a&#10;number of concerns which need to be addressed prior to the Bank moving forward&#10;on the transaction. First, the pro-forma rental rates, when compared on a&#10;Bedroom to Bedroom basis, are high relative to the market. We adjusted&#10;pro-forma downward to match the market rates and the rates per bedroom we are&#10;acheiving on the existing Sagewood project. Additionally, there are about &#10;500+&#10;units coming on-line within the next 12 months in the City of San Marcos, &#10;this,&#10;we believe will causes some downward rent pressures which can have a serious&#10;effect on an over leveraged project. We have therefore adjusted the requested&#10;loan amount to $8,868,000.&#10;&#10;I have summarized our issues as follows:&#10;&#10;1. Pro-forma rental rates were adjusted downward to market as follows:&#10;&#10; Pro-Forma Bank&apos;s Adjustment&#10; Unit Unit Rent Rent/BR Unit Rent Rent/BR&#10; 2 BR/2.5 BA $1,150 $575 $950 $475&#10; 3 BR/Unit $1,530 $510 $1,250 $417&#10;&#10;2. Pro-forma expenses were increased to include a $350/unit reserve for unit&#10;turn over.&#10;&#10;3. A market vacancy factor of 5% was applied to Potential Gross Income (PGI).&#10;&#10;4. Based on the Bank&apos;s revised N.O.I. of $1,075,000, the project can support&#10;debt in the amount of $8,868,000, and maintain our loan parameters of 1.25x &#10;debt&#10;coverage ratio, on a 25 year amo., and 8.60% phantom interest rate.&#10;&#10;5. The debt service will be approx. $874,000/year.&#10;&#10;6. Given the debt of $8,868,000, the Borrower will be required to provide&#10;equity of $2,956,000, consisting of the following:&#10;&#10; Land - $1,121,670&#10; Deferred profit&amp; Overhead $ 415,000&#10; Cash Equity $1,419,268&#10; Total $2,955,938&#10;&#10;7. Equity credit for deferred profit and overhead was limited to a percentage &#10;of&#10;actual hard construction costs.&#10;&#10;(See attached file: MAPTTRA.xls)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; - MAPTTRA.xls&#10;</body></mail>

There is no payment since the beginning of &#10;the year.&#10;&#10;#33 You email said they paid $140 on 1/30 plus $14 in late fees, but I don&apos;t &#10;see that on the 1/26 or 2/2 deposit?&#10;&#10;The last three questions add up to over $1200 in missing rent.

First, do you know if I am to receive a personal financial statement from&#10;Keith? I want to make sure my credit write-up includes all the principals in&#10;the transaction.&#10;&#10;2. Second, without the forward or take-out our typical Loan to Cost (LTC) &#10;will&#10;be in the range of 75% - 80%. The proposed Loan to Value of 75% is within the&#10;acceptable range for a typical Multi-Family deal. Given the above pro-forma&#10;performance on the Sagewood Townhomes, I am structuring the deal to my credit&#10;officer as an 80% LTC. This, of course, is subject to the credit officer&#10;signing off on the deal.&#10;&#10;3. The Bank can not give dollar for dollar equity credit on the Developers&#10;deferred profit. Typically, on past deals a 10% of total project budget as&#10;deferred profit has been acceptable.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Andrew Ozuna&#10;Real Estate Loan Officer&#10;210-271-8386&#10;##&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

They do not want the school&#10;to come back at a later date for something different. Doug Bell will meet&#10;with a school official on Monday to see what their thoughts are about the&#10;subject. It would be hard for them to change the current agreement, but AMF&#10;wants something in writing to that effect. I spoke to AMF&apos;s attorney today,&#10;and explained the situation. They are OK with deal if AMF is satisfied.&#10;&#10;AMF&apos;s broker said that they will be ready to submit their site plan after&#10;the March 29 hearing.

Review and document systems and processes - The handoffs from ERMS, &#10;TAGG, Unify, Sitara and other systems are not clearly understood by all the &#10; parties trying to make improvements. I think I understand ERMS and &#10;TAGG but the issues facing &#10; scheduling in Unify are grey.&#10;&#10;2. Review and audit complex deals- Under the &quot;assume it is messed up&quot; &#10;policy, existing deals could use a review and the booking of new deals need &#10;further scrutiny.&#10;&#10;3. Review risk books- Is Enron accurately accounting for physical &#10;imbalances, transport fuel, park and loan transactions?&#10;&#10;4. Lead trading track program- Recruit, oversee rotations, design training &#10;courses, review progress and make cuts.&#10;&#10;5. Fundamentals- Liason between trading and analysts. Are we looking at &#10;everything we should? Putting a person with a trading mentality should add &#10; some value and direction to the group.&#10;&#10;&#10;In fact there is so much work she could do that you probably need a second MD &#10;to work part time to get it done.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>

Their version includes the salary of a &#10;superintendent and a junior superintendent as hard costs equivalent to third &#10;party subs and materials. Then there is a layer of &quot;construction management&quot; &#10;fees of 10%. There are some small incidental cost that they listed would be &#10;paid out of this money. But I think the majority of it is profit. Finally &#10;the builders profit of 1.4 million.&#10;&#10;Keith and I were not sure whether we would be open to paying the supers out &#10;of the cost or having them be paid out of the builders profit. After all, if &#10;they are the builders why does there need to be two additional supervisors? &#10;We were definitely not intending to insert an additional 10% fee in addition &#10;to the superintendent costs. George claims that all of these costs have been &#10;in the cost estimates that we have been using. I reviewed the estimates and &#10;the superintendents are listed but I don&apos;t think the construction management &#10;fee is included.&#10;&#10;George gave me some contracts that show how these fees are standard. I will &#10;review and let you know what I think.&#10;&#10;The GP issues don&apos;t seem to be a point of contention. They are agreeable to &#10;the 3 out 4 approval process.&#10;&#10;Let me know if you have opinions or sources that I can use to push for only &#10;true costs + 1.4 million.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>

I know you mentioned the deposit would be 5360.65 which is what the bank &#10;is showing, but the rentroll only adds up to 4865. The missing money on the &#10;spreadsheet is probably the answer to my other questions below.&#10;&#10;2. #1 Did he pay the rent he missed on 1/26?&#10;&#10;3. #3 Did he miss rent on 1/26 and 2/2?&#10;&#10;4. #11 Missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;5. #13 Missed on 1/26?&#10;&#10;6. #14 missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;7. #15 missed on 2/2 and has not paid the 95 from 1/19?&#10;&#10;8. #20a missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;9. #35 missed on 2/2?&#10;&#10;My guess is some of these were paid but not recorded on the 2/2 rentroll. &#10;You may have sent me a message over the &quot;chat&quot; line that I don&apos;t remember on &#10;some of these.

Investment is a loan with prime + 1% rate&#10;&#10;2. Construction contract is cost plus $1.4 Million&#10;&#10;3. The investors&apos; loan is repaid before any construction profit is paid.&#10;&#10;4. All parties are GP&apos;s but 3 out 4 votes needed for major decisions?&#10;&#10;5. 60/40 split favoring the investors.&#10;&#10;With regard to the construction contract, we are concerned about getting a &#10;solid line by line cost estimate and clearly defining what constitutes &#10;costs. Then we need a mechanism to track the actual expenses. Keith and I &#10;would like to oversee the bookkeeping. The builders would be requred to fax &#10;all invoices within 48 hours. We also would want online access to the &#10;checking account of the partnership so we could see if checks were clearing &#10;but invoices were not being submitted.&#10;&#10;Let me know if you can draft these agreements.

Exposure to interest fluctuations, the &#10;large cash reserves needed, and the limited financial resources of the buyer &#10;are the three biggest concerns. &#10;&#10;What I am willing to do is lower the second note to 8% amortized over the &#10;buyers choice of terms up to 30 years. The existing note does not come due &#10;until September 2009. That is a long time. The buyer may have sold the &#10;property. Interest rates may be lower.

I have shifted &#10;to a slightly different plan. There were too many design items that I could &#10;not work out in the plan we discussed previously. Now, I am leaning more &#10;towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. One &#10;wing would have a living/dining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with 3 &#10;kid bedrooms + a laundry room upstairs. The other wing would have a garage + &#10;guestroom downstairs with a game room + office/exercise room upstairs. This &#10;plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the &#10;courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor &#10;living. I am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west. &#10; The center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass &#10;skylights supported by metal posts. I am envisioning the two wings to have &#10;single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. &#10;&#10;I don&apos;t know if you can imagine the house I am trying to describe. I would &#10;like to come and visit you again this month. If it would work for you, I &#10;would like to drive up on Sunday afternoon on Feb. 18 around 2 or 3 pm. I &#10;would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we &#10;didn&apos;t have time for. I can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. &#10;&#10;Call or email to let me know if this would work for you. &#10;pallen70@hotmail.com or 713-463-8626(home), 713-853-7041(work)&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip Allen&#10;&#10;&#10;PS.

Operating expenses include $22,000 of materials for maintenance and &#10;repairs. Plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor &#10;cost for repairs. There are only 44 units a lot of his time is spent on &#10;repairs.&#10;&#10;2. What is an outside management firm going to do? A full time onsite &#10;manager is all that is required. As I mentioned the prior manager has &#10;interest in returning. Another alternative would be to hire a male manager &#10;that could do more make readies and lawn care. If you turn it over to a &#10;management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager &#10;onsite.&#10;&#10;3. Considering #1 &amp; #2 $115,000 NOI is not necessarily overstated. If you &#10;want to be ultra conservative use $100,000 at the lowest.&#10;&#10;4. Getting cash out is not a priority to me. So I am willing to structure &#10;this deal with minimum cash. A 10% note actually attractive. See below.&#10;&#10;My job just doesn&apos;t give me the time to manage this property. This property &#10;definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.&#10;&#10;&#10;Sales Price 705,000&#10;&#10;1st Lien 473,500&#10;&#10;2nd Lien 225,000&#10;&#10;Transfer fee 7,500&#10;&#10;Cash required 14,500&#10;&#10;&#10;NOI 100,000&#10;&#10;1st Lien 47,292&#10;&#10;2nd Lien 23,694&#10;&#10;Cash flow 29,014&#10;&#10;Cash on cash 200%&#10;&#10;&#10;These numbers are using the conservative NOI, if it comes in at $115K then &#10;cash on cash return would be more like 300%. This doesn&apos;t reflect the &#10;additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years &#10;for a higher price.&#10;&#10;Do you want to reconsider? Let me know.&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;</body></mail>

Cash Needs&#10;Highlights:&#10;SCE=01,s original cash forecast, dated as December 28, 2000, projects a com=&#10;plete=20&#10;cash depletion date of February 1, 2001. Since then SCE has instituted a=20&#10;program of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligation=&#10;s=20&#10;and other measures.=20&#10;Based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities, SCE=01,s=20&#10;available cash improved through January 19 from an original estimate of $51=&#10;.8=20&#10;million to $1.226 billion. The actual cash flow, given these cash=20&#10;conservation activities, extends the cash depletion date.&#10;II. Credit Relationships&#10;Highlights:&#10;SCE has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able to=20&#10;extend or renew credit as it has become due.&#10;At present, there are no additional sources of credit open to SCE.&#10;SCE=01,s loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to defau=&#10;lt.=20&#10;Generally, these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due a=&#10;nd=20&#10;payable.&#10;SCE=01,s utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bond=&#10;=20&#10;indebtedness, although there is some statutory capacity to issue more=20&#10;indebtedness if it were feasible to do so.&#10;Credit ratings agencies have downgraded SCE=01,s credit ratings on most of =&#10;its=20&#10;rated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment grade=&#10;=20&#10;issues within the last three weeks.&#10;III. Energy Cost Scenarios&#10;Highlights&#10;This report section uses different CPUC supplied assumptions to assess=20&#10;various price scenarios upon SCE=01,s projected cash depletion dates. Under=&#10; such=20&#10;scenarios, SCE would have a positive cash balance until March 30, 2001.&#10;IV. Cost Containment Initiatives&#10;Highlights&#10;SCE has adopted a $460 million Cost Reduction Plan for the year 2001.&#10;The Plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capital=&#10;=20&#10;improvement component as follows (in millions):&#10;Operating and maintenance costs $ 77&#10;Capital Improvement Costs 383&#10;Total $ 460&#10;The Plan provides for up to 2,000 full, part-time and contract positions to=&#10;=20&#10;be eliminated with approximately 75% of the total staff reduction coming fr=&#10;om=20&#10;contract employees.&#10;Under the Plan, Capital Improvement Costs totaling $383 million are for the=&#10;=20&#10;most part being deferred to a future date.&#10;SCE dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders and=20&#10;executive bonuses have been suspended, resulting in an additional cost=20&#10;savings of approximately $92 million.&#10;V. Accounting Mechanisms to Track Stranded Cost Recovery (TRA and TCBA=20&#10;Activity)&#10;Highlights:&#10;As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an overcollected balance in the=20&#10;Transition Cost Balancing Account (TCBA) Account of $494.5 million. This=20&#10;includes an estimated market valuation of its hydro facilities of $500=20&#10;million and accelerated revenues of $175 million.&#10;As of December 31, 2000, SCE reported an undercollected balance in SCE=01,s=&#10;=20&#10;Transition Account (TRA) of $4.49 billion.&#10;Normally, the generation memorandum accounts are credited to the TCBA at th=&#10;e=20&#10;end of each year. However, the current generation memorandum account credit=&#10;=20&#10;balance of $1.5 billion has not been credited to the TCBA, pursuant to=20&#10;D.01-01-018.&#10;Costs of purchasing generation are tracked in the TRA and revenues from=20&#10;generation are tracked in the TCBA. Because these costs and revenues are=20&#10;tracked separately, the net liability from procuring electric power, as=20&#10;expressed in the TRA, are overstated.&#10;TURN Proposal&#10;As part of our review, the CPUC asked that we comment on the proposal of TU=&#10;RN=20&#10;to change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition asset=&#10;s.=20&#10;Our comments are summarized as follows:&#10;The Proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of SCE in that i=&#10;t=20&#10;would not directly generate nor use cash.&#10;The Proposal=01,s impact on SCE=01,s balance sheet would initially be to sh=&#10;ift=20&#10;costs between two regulatory assets.&#10;TURN=01,s proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and=&#10; the=20&#10;revenues from generating power are tracked separately, the undercollection =&#10;in=20&#10;the TRA is overstated.&#10;VI. Flow of Funds Analysis&#10;Highlights:&#10;In the last five years, SCE had generated net income of $2.7 billion and a=&#10;=20&#10;positive cash flow from operations of $7 billion.&#10;During the same time period, SCE paid dividends and other distributions to=&#10;=20&#10;its parent, Edison International, of approximately $4.8 billion.&#10;Edison International used the funds from dividends to pay dividends to its=&#10;=20&#10;shareholders of $1.6 billion and repurchased shares of its outstanding comm=&#10;on=20&#10;stock of $2.7 billion, with the remaining funds being used for administrati=&#10;ve=20&#10;and general costs, investments, and other corporate purposes.&#10;[there is no Section VII]&#10;=20&#10;VIII. Earnings of California Affiliates&#10;SCE=01,s payments for power to its affiliates were approximately $400-$500=&#10;=20&#10;million annually and remained relatively stable from 1996 through 1999.=20&#10;In 2000, the payments increased by approximately 50% to over $600 million.=&#10;=20&#10;This increase correlates to the increase in market prices&#10;for natural gas for the same period.&#10;A copy of the report is available on the Commission website at=20&#10;www.cpuc.ca.gov.&#10;=20&#10;Dan&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

I would like to get it sold by the end of March. I have &#10;about $225K invested in the stagecoach, &#10; it looks like I need to get around $745K to breakeven. &#10;&#10;I don&apos;t need the cash out right now so if I could get a personal guarantee &#10;and Jaques Craig can &#10;work out the partnership transfer, I would definitely be willing to carry a &#10;second lien. I understand second liens are going for 10%-12%.&#10;Checkout this spreadsheet.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;These numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. &#10;However, I am very concerned about the way it is being shown. Having Lucy &#10;show it is not a good idea. I need you to meet the buyers and take some &#10;trips over to get more familar with the property. My dad doesn&apos;t have the &#10;time and I don&apos;t trust &#10;Lucy or Wade to show it correctly. I would prefer for you to show it from &#10;now on. &#10;&#10;I will have the operating statements complete through December by this &#10;Friday. &#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be &#10;recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would &#10;be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the &#10;investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned &#10;earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as &#10;part of the construction contract. &#10;&#10;Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look &#10;like here are a few ideas:&#10;&#10; 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million.

Traders put the two together, anticipated a &#10;supply crunch and drove gas prices to record heights. &#10;&#10;&quot;Traders do that all the time; they&apos;re looking forward,&quot; said William Burson, &#10;a trader. &quot;It makes the market for natural gas.&quot; &#10;&#10;But the market&apos;s response perplexed Chris McGill, the American Gas &#10;Association&apos;s director of gas supply and transportation. He had compiled the &#10;storage numbers since they were first published in 1994, and in his view the &#10;numbers were being misinterpreted to show a situation far bleaker than &#10;reality. &#10;&#10;&quot;It&apos;s a little frustrating that they don&apos;t take the time to understand what &#10;we are reporting,&quot; McGill said. &#10;&#10;As consumer outrage builds over high heating bills, the hunt for reasons -- &#10;and culprits -- is on. Some within the natural gas industry are pointing &#10;fingers at Wall Street. &#10;&#10;Stephen Adik, senior vice president of the Indiana utility NiSource, recently &#10;stepped before an industry conference and blamed the market&apos;s speculators for &#10;the rise in gas prices. &#10;&#10;&quot;It&apos;s my firm belief ... that today&apos;s gas prices are being manipulated,&quot; Adik &#10;told the trade magazine Public Utilities Fortnightly. &#10;&#10;In California, where natural gas spikes have contributed to an electric &#10;utility crisis, six investigations are looking into the power industry. &#10;&#10;Closer to home, observers note that utilities and regulators share the blame &#10;for this winter&apos;s startling gas bills, having failed to protect their &#10;customers and constituents from such price spikes. &#10;&#10;Most utilities, often with the acquiescence of regulators, failed to take &#10;precautions such as fixed-rate contracts and hedging -- a sort of price &#10;insurance -- that could have protected their customers by locking in gas &#10;prices before they soared. &#10;&#10;&quot;We&apos;re passing on our gas costs, which we have no control over,&quot; said Paul &#10;Snider, a spokesman for Missouri Gas Energy. &#10;&#10;But critics say the utilities shirked their responsibility to customers. &#10;&#10;&quot;There&apos;s been a failure of risk management by utilities, and that needs to &#10;change,&quot; said Ed Krapels, director of gas power services for Energy Security &#10;Analysis Inc., an energy consulting firm in Wakefield, Mass. &#10;&#10;&#10;Hot topic &#10;&#10;Consumers know one thing for certain: Their heating bills are up sharply. In &#10;many circles, little else is discussed. &#10;&#10;The Rev. Vincent Fraser of Glad Tidings Assembly of God in Kansas City is &#10;facing a $1,456 December bill for heating the church -- more than double the &#10;previous December&apos;s bill. Church members are suffering from higher bills as &#10;well. &#10;&#10;The Sunday collection is down, said Fraser, who might have to forgo part of &#10;his salary. For the first time, the church is unable to meet its financial &#10;pledge to overseas missionaries because the money is going to heating. &#10;&#10;&quot;It&apos;s the talk of the town here,&quot; he said. &#10;&#10;A year ago that wasn&apos;t a fear. Wholesale gas prices hovered just above $2 per &#10;thousand cubic feet -- a level that producers say didn&apos;t make it worthwhile &#10;to drill for gas. Utilities were even cutting the gas prices paid by &#10;customers. &#10;&#10;But trouble was brewing. By spring, gas prices were hitting $4 per thousand &#10;cubic feet, just as utilities were beginning to buy gas to put into storage &#10;for winter. &#10;&#10;There was a dip in the fall, but then prices rebounded. By early November, &#10;prices were at $5 per thousand cubic feet. The federal Energy Information &#10;Administration was predicting sufficient but tight gas supplies and heating &#10;bills that would be 30 percent to 40 percent higher. &#10;&#10;But $10 gas was coming. Below-normal temperatures hit much of the country, &#10;including the Kansas City area, and fears about tight supplies roiled the gas &#10;markets. &#10;&#10;&quot;It&apos;s all about the weather,&quot; said Krapels of Energy Security Analysis. &#10;&#10;Wholesale prices exploded to $10 per thousand cubic feet, led by the New York &#10;traders. Natural gas sealed its reputation as the most price-volatile &#10;commodity in the world. &#10;&#10;&#10;Setting the price &#10;&#10;In the 1980s, the federal government took the caps off the wellhead price of &#10;gas, allowing it to float. In 1990, the New York Mercantile began trading &#10;contracts for future delivery of natural gas, and that market soon had &#10;widespread influence over gas prices. &#10;&#10;The futures contracts are bought and sold for delivery of natural gas as soon &#10;as next month or as far ahead as three years. Suppliers can lock in sale &#10;prices for the gas they expect to produce. And big gas consumers, from &#10;utilities to companies such as Farmland Industries Inc., can lock in what &#10;they pay for the gas they expect to use. &#10;&#10;There are also speculators who trade the futures contracts with no intention &#10;of actually buying or selling the gas -- and often with little real knowledge &#10;of natural gas. &#10;&#10;But if they get on the right side of a price trend, traders don&apos;t need to &#10;know much about gas -- or whatever commodity they&apos;re trading. Like all &#10;futures, the gas contracts are purchased on credit. That leverage adds to &#10;their volatility and to the traders&apos; ability to make or lose a lot of money &#10;in a short time. &#10;&#10;As December began, the price of natural gas on the futures market was less &#10;than $7 per thousand cubic feet. By the end of the month it was nearly $10. &#10;Much of the spark for the rally came from the American Gas Association&apos;s &#10;weekly storage numbers. &#10;&#10;Utilities buy ahead and store as much as 50 percent of the gas they expect to &#10;need in the winter. &#10;&#10;Going into the winter, the storage levels were about 5 percent less than &#10;average, in part because some utilities were holding off on purchasing, in &#10;hopes that the summer&apos;s unusually high $4 to $5 prices would drop. &#10;&#10;Still, the American Gas Association offered assurances that supplies would be &#10;sufficient. But when below-normal temperatures arrived in November, the &#10;concerns increased among traders that supplies could be insufficient. &#10;&#10;Then the American Gas Association reported the lowest year-end storage &#10;numbers since they were first published in 1994. Still, said the &#10;association&apos;s McGill, there was sufficient gas in storage. &#10;&#10;But some utility executives didn&apos;t share that view. William Eliason, vice &#10;president of Kansas Gas Service, said that if December&apos;s cold snap had &#10;continued into January, there could have been a real problem meeting demand. &#10;&#10;&quot;I was getting worried,&quot; he said. &#10;&#10;Then suddenly the market turned when January&apos;s weather turned warmer. &#10;Wednesday&apos;s storage numbers were better than expected, and futures prices &#10;dropped more than $1 per thousand cubic feet. &#10;&#10;&#10;Just passing through &#10;&#10;Some utilities said there was little else to do about the price increase but &#10;pass their fuel costs on to customers. &#10;&#10;Among area utilities, Kansas Gas Service increased its customers&apos; cost-of-gas &#10;charge earlier this month to $8.68 per thousand cubic feet. And Missouri Gas &#10;Energy has requested an increase to $9.81, to begin Wednesday. &#10;&#10;Sheila Lumpe, chairwoman of the Missouri Public Service Commission, said last &#10;month that because utilities passed along their wholesale costs, little could &#10;be done besides urging consumers to join a level-payment plan and to conserve &#10;energy. &#10;&#10;Kansas Gas Service had a small hedging program in place, which is expected to &#10;save an average customer about $25 this winter. &#10;&#10;Missouri Gas Energy has no hedging program. It waited until fall to seek an &#10;extension of the program and then decided to pass when regulators would not &#10;guarantee that it could recover its hedging costs. &#10;&#10;Now utilities are being asked to justify the decisions that have left &#10;customers with such high gas bills. And regulators are being asked whether &#10;they should abandon the practice of letting utilities pass along their fuel &#10;costs. &#10;&#10;On Friday, Doug Micheel, senior counsel of the Missouri Office of the Public &#10;Counsel, said his office would ask the Missouri Public Service Commission to &#10;perform an emergency audit of Missouri Gas Energy&apos;s gas purchasing practices. &#10;&#10;&quot;Consumers are taking all the risk,&quot; Micheel said. &quot;It&apos;s time to consider &#10;some changes.&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;To reach Steve Everly, call (816) 234-4455 or send e-mail to &#10;severly@kcstar.com. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;------------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;--&#10;All content , 2001 The Kansas City Star </body></mail>

Note that the&#10;construction management fee (CMF) is stated at 12.5% rather than our&#10;standard rate of 10%. This will increase cost and with a loan to cost ratio&#10;of 75%, this will increase the loan amount and reduce required cash equity.&#10;&#10;Also, we are quite confident that the direct unit and lot improvement costs&#10;are high. Therefore, we should have some additional room once we have&#10;actual bids, as The Met project next door is reported to have cost $49 psf&#10;without overhead or CMF, which is $54-55 with CMF.&#10;&#10;It appears that the cash equity will be $1,784,876. However, I am fairly&#10;sure that we can get this project done with $1.5MM.&#10;&#10;I hope to finish the proforma today. The rental rates that we project are&#10;$1250 for the 3 ADA units, $1150-1200 for the 2 bedroom and $1425 for the 3&#10;bedroom. Additional revenues could be generated by building detached&#10;garages, which would rent for $50-75 per month.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; - winmail.dat&#10;</body></mail>

Check my math, but it looks like all the builders profit would be &#10;recouped in the first year of operation. At permanent financing $1.1 would &#10;be paid, leaving only .3 to pay out in the 1st year.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Since almost 80% of builders profit is repaid at the same time as the &#10;investment, I feel the 65/35 is a fair split. However, as I mentioned &#10;earlier, I think we should negotiate to layer on additional equity to you as &#10;part of the construction contract. &#10;&#10;Just to begin the brainstorming on what a construction agreement might look &#10;like here are a few ideas:&#10;&#10; 1. Fixed construction profit of $1.4 million. Builder doesn&apos;t benefit from &#10;higher cost, rather suffers as an equity holder.&#10;&#10; 2. +5% equity for meeting time and costs in original plan ($51/sq ft, phase &#10;1 complete in November)&#10; +5% equity for under budget and ahead of schedule&#10; -5% equity for over budget and behind schedule&#10;&#10;This way if things go according to plan the final split would be 60/40, but &#10;could be as favorable as 55/45. I realize that what is budget and schedule &#10;must be discussed and agreed upon.&#10;&#10;Feel free to call me at home (713)463-8626&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip&#10; &#10; </body></mail>

One for $150 and the other &#10;for $75. Which apartments? 20a or #13?&#10;&#10; Utility overages for #26 and #44? Where did you get these amounts? For &#10;what periods?&#10;&#10; &#10;What is going on with #42. Do not evict this tenant for being unclean!!! &#10;That will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money &#10;and time remodeling. I would rather try and deal with this tenant by first &#10;asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like &#10;leaky pipes. If that doesn&apos;t work, we should tell them we will clean the &#10;apartment and charge them for the labor. Then we will perform monthly &#10;inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. This tenant has &#10;been here since September 1998, I don&apos;t want to run them off.&#10;&#10;I check with the bank and I did not see that a deposit was made on Tuesday so &#10;I couldn&apos;t check the total from the rentroll against the bank.

In attendance were Ken Lay, &#10;the Governor, the Governor&apos;s staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself. The gov. &#10;spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his &#10;ideas. He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next &#10;week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday. &#10;Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on &#10;my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff &#10;Dasovich and I prepared. Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our &#10;proposals, the governor&apos;s ideas, as well as my overview of the situation &#10;based on the governor&apos;s comments:&#10;&#10;Overview: We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that &#10;we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing &#10;communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to &#10;go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what &#10;the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees. His staff has more &#10;work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. He &#10;talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail &#10;level. He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the &#10;benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he &#10;would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power &#10;(which he estimates at 3000MW). He foresees a mix of market oriented &#10;solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix &#10;the problem by &apos;02 and provide some political cover.&#10;Our proposals: I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also &#10;included the forward price information several of you provided). He seemed &#10;interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a &#10;goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities &#10;to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate &#10;analysts and other &quot;nonadvocates&quot; to develop solutions to a number of issues &#10;including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. &#10;He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas &#10;purchases. As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding &#10;some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.&#10;His ideas: The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously &#10;under serious consideration and some of which were mere &quot;brainstorming&quot;. &#10;Some of these ideas would require legislative action.&#10;State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a &quot;couple&quot; of &#10;generation plants. The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that &#10;they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. This &#10;was a frequently recurring theme.&#10;Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus &#10;basis to consumers.&#10;Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in &#10;California.&#10;State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more &#10;widely deploy distributed generation.&#10;Expand in-state gas production.&#10;Take state lands gas royalties in kind.&#10;negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for &#10;addtional gas supplies.&#10;Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant &#10;maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at &#10;any one time.&#10;Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.&#10;Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear &#10;more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder&apos;s group should be &#10;able to help out here).&#10;Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. We made &#10;some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy &#10;some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation &#10;thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control &#10;approach with generators.&#10;Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.&#10;To dos: (Jeff, again I&apos;d like to prevail on you to assemble the group&apos;s &#10;thoughts and get them to Kari)&#10;He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload -- &#10;not just the 5 one year strips.&#10;He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.&#10;He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the &#10;deal.&#10;He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the &#10;forward contracting issues.&#10;Thanks to everyone for their help. We made some progress today.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

The project is a 134 unit apartment complex in &#10;San Marcos. There will be a builder/developer plus myself and possibly a &#10;couple of other investors involved. As I mentioned last week, I would like &#10;to find interim financing (land, construction, semi-perm) that does not &#10;require the investors to personally guarantee. If there is a creative way to &#10;structure the deal, I would like to hear your suggestions. One idea that has &#10;been mentioned is to obtain a &quot;forward commitment&quot; in order to reduce the &#10;equity required. I would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this &#10;nature are normally financed. Specifically, the transition from interim to &#10;permanent financing. I could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be &#10;important to banks. &#10;&#10; I am faxing you a project summary.

If &#10;you need to call with questions my home number is 713-463-8626.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;As far as recommendations, here is a short list:&#10;&#10; 1. Examine LDC&apos;s incentive rate program. Current methodology rewards sales &#10;above monthly index without enough consideration of future &#10; replacement cost. The result is that the LDC&apos;s sell gas that should be &#10;injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index.&#10; This creates a shortage in later months.&#10;&#10; 2. California has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet &#10;demand. Investigate why it wasn&apos;t maximized operationally. &#10; Specific questions should include: &#10;&#10; 1. Why in March &apos;00-May &apos;00 weren&apos;t total system receipts higher in order &#10;to fill storage?&#10;&#10; 2. Why are there so many examples of OFO&apos;s on weekends that push away too &#10;much gas from Socal&apos;s system. &#10; I believe Socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their &#10;own demand. They repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than &#10;their injection capablity, but injected far less.&#10;&#10; 3. Similar to the power market, there is too much benchmarking to short &#10;term prices. Not enough forward hedging is done by the major &#10; LDCs. By design the customers are short at a floating &#10;rate. This market has been long historically. It has been a buyers market &#10;and the &#10; consumer has benefitted. &#10;&#10;&#10;Call me if you need any more input.&#10;&#10;&#10;Phillip</body></mail>

If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where &#10;did they come from? I can&apos;t relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.&#10;&#10;As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our &#10;comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the &#10;charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It&apos;s much &#10;better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the &#10;whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.&#10;&#10;Thanks.&#10;&#10;&#10; &#10; &#10; &#10; From: Phillip K Allen 12/13/2000 03:04 PM&#10; &#10;&#10;To: Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, James D Steffes/NA/Enron@ENRON, Jeff &#10;Dasovich/NA/Enron@ENRON, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@ECT, &#10;pallen@enron.com, pkaufma@enron.com, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard &#10;Shapiro/NA/Enron@ENRON, Stephanie Miller/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J &#10;Kean/NA/Enron@ENRON, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Rebecca W &#10;Cantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: &#10;&#10;Attached are two files that illustrate the following:&#10;&#10;As prices rose, supply increased and demand decreased.

Crocker&quot; &#10;&lt;clclegal2@aol.com&gt; &#10;Subject: Investment Structure&#10;&#10;&#10;STRUCTURE:&#10;Typically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)&#10;general partner. The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the&#10;liability of construction.&#10;&#10;LAND OWNERSHIP &amp; LOANS&#10;The property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and&#10;any land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in&#10;the name of the limited partnership. Each of the individual investors and&#10;all of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the&#10;loans. If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means&#10;that a larger amount of cash is required and the investor&apos;s share of profits&#10;is reduced.&#10;&#10;All loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are&#10;full recourse loans. If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,&#10;the construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be&#10;non-recourse.&#10;&#10;USE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT&#10;The initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &amp;&#10;architectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for&#10;organization and condominium association formation, and appraisals. Unlike&#10;many real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to&#10;Creekside Builders, LLC. These professional expenses will be incurred over&#10;the estimated 6 month design and approval period.&#10;&#10;EARLY LAND COSTS&#10;The $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost&#10;represent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of&#10;extensions on closing. As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at&#10;probably 70% of appraised value. With a land value equal to the purchase&#10;price of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated&#10;monthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus&#10;approximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.&#10;&#10;EQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN&#10;Once the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require&#10;the development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as&#10;the &quot;fiscals&quot;. This cost represents a bond for the completion of&#10;improvements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the&#10;improvements have been completed and accepted by COA. This release will be&#10;for 90% of the cost with the remaining 10% released one year after&#10;completion. Releases can be granted once every 90 days and you should&#10;expect that the release would occur 6 months after the start of lot&#10;improvement construction. These fiscals are usually posted in cash or an&#10;irrevocable letter of credit. As such, they have to be counted as a&#10;development cost, even though they are not spent. Because they are not&#10;spent no interest is charged on these funds.&#10;&#10;The lot improvement loan is typically 75% of the appraised value of a&#10;finished lot, which I suspect will be at least $20,000 and potentially as&#10;high as $25,000. This would produce a loan amount of $15,000 on $20,000&#10;per lot. With estimated per lot improvement costs of $9,000, &apos;fiscals&apos; at&#10;$2,000 and the land cost at $8,000 , total improved lot cost is $19,000&#10;which means $0 to $4,000 per lot in total equity. The investment prior to&#10;obtaining the improvement loan would count towards any equity requirement&#10;provided it was for direct costs. Thus, the additional equity for the&#10;improvement loan would be $0-$184,000. Even if the maximum loan would&#10;cover all costs, it is unlikely the bank would allow reimbursement of funds&#10;spent. The higher estimates of equity investments are shown in the&#10;preliminary proforma to be on the safe side. The engineer is preparing a&#10;tentative site layout with an initial evaluation of the phasing, which can&#10;significantly reduce the cash equity requirement.&#10;&#10;Phasing works as follows. If the first phase was say 40 units, the total&#10;lot improvement cost might average $31,000 per lot. Of this, probably&#10;$13,000 would be for improvements and $19,000 for the land cost. The&#10;improvements are higher to cover large one time up front costs for design&#10;costs, the entry road, water treatment costs, perimeter fencing and&#10;landscaping, and so on, as well as for 100% of the land. The land loan for&#10;undeveloped lots would be 70% of the appraised raw lot value, which I would&#10;estimate as $10,000 per lot for a loan value of $7,000 per lot. Then the&#10;loan value for each improved lot would be $15,000 per lot. This would give&#10;you a total loan of $992,000, total cost of $1,232,645 for equity required&#10;of $241,000. This was not presented in the initial analysis as the phasing&#10;is depended on a more careful assessment by the Civil Engineer as the&#10;separate phases must each be able to stand on its own from a utility&#10;standpoint.&#10;&#10;CONSTRUCTION LOANS&#10;There are three types of construction loans. First, is a speculative&#10;(spec) loan that is taken out prior to any pre-sales activity. Second, is&#10;a construction loan for a pre-sold unit, but the loan remains in the&#10;builder/developers name. Third, is a pre-sold unit with the construction&#10;loan in the name of the buyer. We expect to have up to 8 spec loans to&#10;start the project and expect all other loans to be pre-sold units with loans&#10;in the name of the builder/developer. We do not expect to have any&#10;construction loans in the name of the buyers, as such loans are too&#10;difficult to manage and please new buyers unfamiliar with the process.&#10;&#10;Spec loans will be for 70% to 75% of value and construction loans for&#10;pre-sold units, if the construction loan is from the mortgage lender, will&#10;be from 80% to 95% of value.&#10;&#10;DISBURSEMENTS&#10;Disbursements will be handled by the General Partner to cover current and&#10;near term third party costs, then to necessary reserves, then to priority&#10;payments and then to the partners per the agreement. The General Partner&#10;will contract with Creekside Builders, LLC to construct the units and the&#10;fee to CB will include a construction management and overhead fee equal to&#10;15% of the direct hard cost excluding land, financing and sales costs.&#10;These fees are the only monies to Creekside, Larry Lewter or myself prior to&#10;calculation of profit, except for a) direct reimbursement for partnership&#10;expenses and b) direct payment to CB for any subcontractor costs that it has&#10;to perform. For example, if CB cannot find a good trim carpenter sub, or&#10;cannot find enough trim carpenters, etc., and it decides to undertake this&#10;function, it will charge the partnership the same fee it was able to obtain&#10;from third parties and will disclose those cases to the partnership.&#10;Finally, CB will receive a fee for the use of any of its equipment if it is&#10;used in lieu of leasing equipment from others. At present CB does not own&#10;any significant equipment, but it is considering the purchase of a sky track&#10;to facilitate and speed up framing, cornice, roofing and drywall spreading.&#10;&#10;REPORTING&#10;We are more than willing to provide reports to track expenses vs. plan.&#10;What did you have in mind? I would like to use some form of internet based&#10;reporting.&#10;&#10;BOOKKEEPING&#10;I am not sure what you are referring to by the question, &quot;Bookkeeping&#10;procedures to record actual expenses?&quot; Please expand.&#10;&#10;INVESTOR INPUT&#10;We are glad to have the investor&apos;s input on design and materials. As always&#10;the question will be who has final say if there is disagreement, but in my&#10;experience I have always been able to reach consensus. As you, and I presume&#10;Keith, want to be involved to learn as much as possible we would make every&#10;effort to be accommodating.&#10;&#10;CREEKSIDE PROCEEDURES&#10;CB procedures for dealing with subs, vendors and professionals is not as&#10;formal as your question indicates. In the EXTREMELY tight labor market&#10;obtaining 3 bids for each labor trade is not feasible. For the professional&#10;subs we use those with whom we have developed a previous rapport. Finally,&#10;for vendors they are constantly shopped.&#10;&#10;PRE-SELECTED PROFESSIONALS, SUBS AND VENDORS&#10;Yes there are many different subs that have been identified and I can&#10;provide these if you are interested.&#10;&#10;I know I have not answered everything, but this is a starting point. Call&#10;when you have reviewed and we can discuss further.&#10;&#10;Sincerely,&#10;&#10;George Richards&#10;President, Creekside Builders, LLC&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; - winmail.dat&#10;</body></mail>

Since we&apos;re ending 2000 and going into a new sales year, I &#10;want to make sure I&apos;m not holding resource open on any accounts which may &#10;not, or should not be on the list of focus accounts which you and your team &#10;have requested our involvement with. I also want to make sure I&apos;m bringing &#10;resource to bear on the accounts which you DO want to engage.&#10;&#10;For example, at one point Siemens was one of them, and with recent &#10;developments, may now be off your list...the last communication I received &#10;from the NYC office re: Siemens was via telephone call on November 3rd, &#10;where they informed me that the primary opportunity looked like it would be &#10;with one of their medical groups based in Chicago. After several &#10;unsuccessful follow-up attempts, I placed the Siemens account in the dormant &#10;category. Yesterday, Jennifer forwarded me information requesting engagement &#10;with your team on CA (Computer Associates) and U.S. Internetworking, and &#10;today American Express has surfaced. Consequently, I think it&apos;s probably a &#10;good idea for me to make sure I&apos;m focused on the right accounts for you. &#10;&#10;I realize you may be in PRC today and/or tomorrow, so perhaps Friday would &#10;work? If not, I would have Monday the 18th available late afternoon, or any &#10;time on December 27th, 28th, or 29th. When would be good for you? Please &#10;let me know!&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;</body></mail>

In the note from Doug Cummins which contained his updated spend &#10;projections, he had the &quot;Professional Services&quot; highlighted with a bunch of &#10;question marks. It is at the bottom of his sheet, and lists a qty of 30 @ &#10;$2000 per = $60,000 --- I assume that&apos;s $2K/hour or per day. Either way, &#10;it&apos;s not something that appears palatable to them (Net Works). I&apos;ll be going &#10;over there in a few minutes, and will try to check w/each of the guys.

Our contracts Director, Tom Moore, and I spoke w/Eric Merten &#10;(PDX) early this afternoon, and he now has the contract. EBS may have some &#10;Intellectual Property issues related to ownership of BMC Consultant-developed &#10;materials (while being paid by Enron). Eric is in the driver&apos;s seat with the &#10;contract at this point. &#10;&#10;I have sent notes to all of the Net Works directors currently engaged in one &#10;form or another with BMC product and/or personnel. In it, they have been &#10;requested to help us understand our opportunity from a number of angles: &#10;Application(s) considered, attractiveness of the new pricing, attractiveness &#10;of the BMC flexibility w/regard to &quot;purchase commitment&quot;, etc. In addition, &#10;I have re-iterated the time urgency.&#10;&#10;I have followed up the note w/telephone calls &amp; messages to all of them: &#10;Doug Cummins, Randy Matson, Bob Martinez, Jim Ogg, and Bruce Smith.

Most everyone we talk to takes a macro view.&#10;&#10;+ Dwight Anderson from Tudor thinks anything above $6 is a sale from the &#10;perspective of shut in industrial demand- he believes that between $6-7 no &#10;industrial (basic industry type) can operate. He tracks all the plant &#10;closures similar to what Elena does in Mike Robert&apos;s group but it seems on a &#10;more comprehensive level (Jen- it would be good for fundamentals to track &#10;this number- do some scenario analysis on it under various economic &#10;conditions- like recession!!). I will try to find out what his total number &#10;for turned back gas is- just ammonia is a little more than 1/2 Bcf which does &#10;not seem all that meaningful but the total may bring us back into balance for &#10;the summer.&#10;&#10;While he&apos;s a seller above $6, he&apos;d also be a buyer of summer at lower levels&#10;He firmly believes in increased production in 02 (still has 1.1 day short) &#10;based on his relationship with the producing community although I personally &#10;think that 1Q02 sees little. I know that the fundamentals group is tracking &#10;these numbers from the producing community and has seen no increase in 3q &#10;over 2q and is doubtful for any in 4q over 3q.&#10;&#10;He really believes theories on products being out of whack- heat/gas, &#10;crude/propane....&#10;&#10;+ Jim Pulaski is a bull period- he really likes april and may on the 0 &#10;storage scenario- I agree that we try to build storage in April but with the &#10;backwardation out there what is the incentive??? as well, with lower &#10;baseloads for the summer- deliverability should not be an issue. I am torn &#10;on this one.&#10;&#10;+ Catequil- new fund- Paul Touradji - used to be with Tiger- they do the same &#10;analysis as Dwight- just starting up and one of their mandates is to be long &#10;nat gas!! through vol or outright.&#10;&#10;+ Harvard- not really sure of the view yet- they have not been active in gas &#10;just crude/products- they like buying cheap vol- because they do not have MTM &#10;issues- they like to look out in the calendar years. &#10;&#10;+ The other people we are starting relationships with in the new year are: &#10;Moore Capital, Global Advisors, Caxton, Paloma Partners, Kingdon, Renaissance &#10;(program trader) - just so you know the names- as I get to know them better, &#10;I&apos;ll try to fwd on thoughts regularly.&#10;&#10;Have a great holiday!

I &#10;suggested they visit with you when they are over in the US. In particular, &#10;Chris Mahoney (gasoil trader) will be in Houston the 27 t0 30. I told him he &#10;should come and watch you deal with the AGA number and NX1 at the same time. &#10;Chris is a really good guy.

Then it saw a better&#10;deal. With California desperate for power and electricity prices hitting&#10;unheard-of peaks, Kaiser shut down its two U.S. smelters last week. It is&#10;selling the electricity it no longer needs -- for about 20 times what it&#10;pays Bonneville under long-standing contracts.&#10;It is a measure of this winter&apos;s fuel crunch: Some big industrial firms in&#10;energy-intensive sectors such as paper, fertilizers, metals and even&#10;oil-field operations can make more money by selling their electricity or&#10;natural gas than manufacturing their products. The shifts by such large&#10;industrial consumers of energy -- described as unprecedented by analysts --&#10;will free up more fuel for households and businesses this winter. But they&#10;also are sowing seeds of potential problems next year. Shortages of aluminum&#10;and fertilizer, for example, are likely to give another upward jolt to&#10;consumer prices and further weaken the economy, analysts said.&#10;&quot;The fertilizer picture is particularly worrying us because we don&apos;t know&#10;what they&apos;re going to use to grow crops with,&quot; said David Wyss, chief&#10;economist at Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s. Some economists have recently increased&#10;their warnings about the damaging impact of this winter&apos;s heating bills on&#10;an already weakening economy. Goldman Sachs analysts last week estimated&#10;that gas heating bills will double this winter to more than $1,000 for a&#10;typical U.S. household.&#10;That and higher electricity prices will cost consumers $20 billion in higher&#10;energy costs compared with a year ago, they estimated, cutting the expected&#10;growth in the nation&apos;s economic output by one percentage point on an annual&#10;rate in the first three months of next year. &quot;Overall, the recent energy&#10;price developments have thus added to the risk of a sharp economic&#10;slowdown,&quot; the Goldman Sachs report concluded. Terra Industries Inc., in&#10;Sioux City, Iowa, has closed three of its six U.S. ammonia plants, which use&#10;natural gas as a main ingredient for fertilizer production. Like Kaiser, the&#10;company realized it would be much more profitable to stop production in&#10;December and sell the natural gas back to the market at current prices,&#10;which are much higher than the price Terra was obligated to pay under its&#10;existing December supply contract, said Mark Rosenbury, chief administrative&#10;officer.&#10;&quot;We looked at these [current] prices and said, &apos;This is crazy,&apos; &quot; he said.&#10;Terra hasn&apos;t disclosed the profit it will make selling its gas, but&#10;Rosenbury said it would be &quot;substantial.&quot; In coming months, Terra&apos;s good&#10;fortune could be reversed. It usually buys gas a month at a time, and the&#10;prices for January delivery most likely will be well above its break-even&#10;point. That would keep Terra&apos;s plants closed, Rosenbury said, but eliminate&#10;the opportunity to sell the natural gas at a profit. &quot;If this persists,&quot;&#10;Rosenbury said, &quot;it&apos;s going to be a real problem.&quot;&#10;He estimates that out of a total annual U.S. production capacity of 18&#10;million tons of ammonia, about 4 million tons of production isn&apos;t operating&#10;now. &quot;Could we be short of fertilizer next spring? It&apos;s possible that&#10;farmers will not have as much as they want,&quot; Rosenbury said. Royster-Clark&#10;Inc., a Norfolk and New York City-based fertilizer manufacturer and&#10;distributor, has shut down its one plant in East Dubuque, Ill.,&#10;indefinitely, and 72 production workers will be laid off, beginning next&#10;month. The story is the same -- natural gas prices are too high to justify&#10;continued production. &quot;We believe it&apos;s likely this is a speculative bubble&#10;[in natural gas prices] that will burst and in a few weeks we&apos;ll be able to&#10;buy gas at a more reasonable price, but that remains to be seen,&quot; said Paul&#10;M. Murphy, the company&apos;s managing director for financial planning. A&#10;continuation of high natural gas prices would likely shrink production and&#10;raise fertilizer prices to a point that could affect farmers&apos; decisions to&#10;plant feed corn, he said. &quot;It&apos;s sticker shock.&quot;&#10;According to Wyss, if this winter remains unusually cold and natural gas&#10;remains above $7 per million cubic feet -- double the level a year ago --&#10;farm products could rise significantly a year from now and into 2002. In the&#10;aluminum industry, several smaller producers have joined Kaiser, the&#10;industry&apos;s No. 2 manufacturer, in closing down, noted Lloyd O&apos;Carroll, an&#10;analyst with BB&amp;T Capital Markets in Richmond.&#10;Aluminum production in November was 8.3 percent below that of November 1999,&#10;and December&apos;s production will be lower still, he said. &quot;We&apos;ll get more&#10;production cut announcements, I think,&quot; he said. A slowing in the U.S. and&#10;world economies next year could ease the impact of reduced aluminum&#10;supplies. &quot;But if the world economy doesn&apos;t fall completely apart, then&#10;[aluminum] prices are going to rise, and they could rise significantly more&#10;than the current forecast,&quot; he said. In Kaiser&apos;s case, it&apos;s an open question&#10;how much of its electric windfall it will keep. Kaiser is contractually&#10;entitled to buy electricity from Bonneville at $22.50 a megawatt per hour,&#10;says spokesman Scott Lamb. That is the power it has sold back to Bonneville&#10;for $550 a megawatt hour for December.&#10;But the Bonneville Authority is pressuring Kaiser to use these and future&#10;profits from power resales to compensate employees at the shut-down plants,&#10;to invest in new electric generating capacity, or even to refund to&#10;Bonneville&apos;s other customers, said Bonneville spokesman Ed Mosey. Kaiser and&#10;Bonneville have negotiated a new power purchase deal to take effect after&#10;next October, but the power authority says it intends to reduce deliveries&#10;to Kaiser if the company tries to pocket the electricity sale profits. &quot;Out&#10;here, a deal is a deal, but it has to be a moral deal. There has to be an&#10;ethical dimension to this and we&apos;re not shy in trying to make sure they live&#10;up their advantage in having access to this publicly-owned power,&quot; Mosey&#10;said.&#10;, 2000 The Washington Post Company&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Perhaps &#10;surprisingly, runs were down again, but most of this was non-CDU, and &#10;gasoline bore the brunt of the output drop as a result. &#10;Distillate demand, the main factor to watch, did fall, but not by much (240 &#10;kbd), and only another weak import showing prevented a build. The cold &#10;weather and switching are definitely having an impact, as this demand is well &#10;above last year&apos;s Y2K inflated levels. Most of the draw was in low sulphur &#10;material, but PADD 1 still suffered a 500 kbbls drop in heating oil stocks. &#10;However, it does sems to be building up in PADD 3.&#10;Gasoline stocks did build, but interestingly only in blending components, not &#10;the finished material. Evidence of high gas prices impacting on production? &#10;Stocks rose in PADD 1 by almost the same amount as they fell in PADD 3. &#10;Imports were very strong, however, at 500 kbd.&#10;Again, the real shoker was resid - demand up 57% to 1600 kbd, an incredibly &#10;high number, and clear evidence (if repeated next week) of switching.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Unfortunately, that &#10;process has not been finalized and as such, Dutch is not yet an associate. &#10;Ted is finalizing the process this week and it will likely require Dutch to &#10;interview with 4 other commercial managers outside of ENA. &#10;&#10;Additionally, there are two other sr. spec. on the gas trading floor in &#10;similar situations and we will be discussing them at a promotion meeting to &#10;be held the first week of Jan. I would like to handle all of these &#10;consistently and had planned to include Dutch&apos;s promotion in this &#10;discussion.

It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn&apos;t seem very &#10;&quot;customer-focused&quot; on BMC&apos;s part.

He states now &#10;that if not purchased now the discount would only be 10-20 % range at a later &#10;date.&#10;&#10;&#10;Bruce&#10;&#10; -----Original Message-----&#10;From: Smith, Bruce &#10;Sent: Wednesday, December 13, 2000 8:35 PM&#10;To: McAuliffe, Bob; Rub, Jenny&#10;Cc: Robinson, Larry&#10;Subject: BMC DEAL &#10;Importance: High&#10;&#10;Jenny/Bob&#10;&#10;Per the BMC deal, here is where we are with Batch Processing:&#10;&#10;TidalSoft, Sysadmiral&#10;Approx. 90 k ( current quote covers us and GPG and does not include SAP ) &#10;We have added a couple of pieces to this and it could bring the cost to 125 k &#10;worst case. This quote covers consulting and maintenance. They are trying &#10;very hard to get a deal done this year and we could probably get our &#10;additional components at the current quote price if we signed. &#10;&#10;BMC, Control -M&#10;Approx. 325 k This is after we remove the SAP modules and components from &#10;the quote. Quote that was sent over from Jeff Youngflesh (Enron GSS) was for &#10;a total of 628 k&#10;&#10;Hardware for either product is approx. 300 k. &#10;&#10;We have conferred with the SAP team and they are not desperate for us to take &#10;over their scheduling but think it is a good idea to include them in our long &#10;term strategy. They actually do not recommend either of these product&apos;s SAP &#10;modules and mentioned a third party product (Autosys) that has connectors &#10;into BMC. We are not sure at this point about a connector into TidalSoft &#10;(Larry if you have info on this please comment).&#10;&#10;Larry&apos;s and his team have eval&apos;d both products and although they are leaning &#10;towards Sysadmiral they are satisfied that both products are acceptable. You &#10;guys make the call as to whether the additional 200 k is worth the weight it &#10;will lend to the EBS/BMC deal. FYI - BMC rep said that we still get 45% &#10;discount if we cut the SAP modules. BMC needs to sit down with PB and learn &#10;how over priced their products are !&#10;&#10;Let me know what you think. If we go TidalSoft I need to push this through &#10;or be advised to let it go till the New Year.&#10;&#10;Thanks&#10;Bruce&#10;&#10;&#10;*****&#10;Also in Quote sent over from Youngflesh :&#10;BMC, Control SA&#10;1.3 M NOT EVALUATED AT THIS TIME - Is a candidate for future &#10;consideration for the Security Admin space but not enough info to speculate &#10;as to whether to try and leverage current deal with EBS. I guess they put &#10;this quote together from info they received from Henry Moreno&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Per your &#10;request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP&apos;s business &#10;partners was e-mailed to you this morning.&#10;&#10;HP contacts to date: &#10;&#10;Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager&#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5587&#10;(Gerry Cashiola&apos;s boss)&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola, sales representative &#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5555&#10;(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)&#10;&#10;Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager&#10;Southeast Region&#10;Austin, TX &#10;(#(512)-257-5735&#10;(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer &#10;leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)&#10;&#10;Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances&#10;Austin, TX&#10;#(512)-257-5736&#10;(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)&#10;&#10;Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions&#10;Cupertino, CA&#10;#(408)-447-5240&#10;(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP&apos;s business &#10;propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value &#10;propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the &#10;11/16th meeting)&#10;&#10;Matt,&#10; &#10;On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron&apos;s &#10;trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit &#10;center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, &#10;held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron&apos;s &#10;products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron &#10;(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).&#10;&#10;On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark &#10;outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and &#10;wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:&#10;&#10;1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola &#10;has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this &#10;information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short &#10;term opportunity. What is HP&apos;s time horizon for short term?&#10;&#10;2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to &#10;explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)&#10;&#10;3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT &#10;Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) &#10;&#10;In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several &#10;decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:&#10;&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More &#10;importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews &#10;of Enron&apos;s products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the &#10;GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been &#10;unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between &#10;Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has &#10;remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior &#10;level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship &#10;forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this &#10;strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But &#10;Gerry&apos;s short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, &#10;rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the &#10;relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and &#10;Greg Pyle. Lovejoy&apos;s boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP&apos;s America&apos;s Central &#10;Region.&#10;&#10; In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding &#10;wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS &#10;initiative by reiterating the following two points: &#10;&#10; a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on &#10;the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only &#10;some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)&#10;&#10; b) HP&apos;s ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP&apos;s &#10;business relationship process with Enron&#10;&#10; Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill &#10;Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in &#10;the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer &#10;in person. &#10;&#10;&#10;We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and &#10;other opportunities. &#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing - Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Sorry I had to leave but I had to&#10;meet with Beth Pearlman. I believe there was a lot of good information&#10;exchanged and that is why we ran so late. I certainly came away with a&#10;different insight to Enron that I did not have before we met.&#10;&#10;Regarding the relationship between Compaq and Enron, I need to make some&#10;things are very clear in our go forward strategy.&#10;&#10;At the end of the day, the account team (Dave Spurlin up through Jeff,&#10;myself and Jerry) own the responsibility for the Enron relationship. If&#10;corporate folks are making deals with Enron, we still have to manage the&#10;account. Peter Blackmore is very clear about that. He was always preserved&#10;the integrity of the account team as being responsible for the customer.&#10;That is why we need to keep Dave focused and knowing what transactions are&#10;taking place within Enron. He isn&apos;t the decision maker on deals like the&#10;EBS one, but as you are well aware of, the EBS contract has impaired other&#10;business opportunities within Enron. Dave&apos;s sole responsibility is Enron and&#10;making sure that your needs are being met. He will direct and assist in&#10;making sure that we have resolutions for situations that impact the&#10;relationship with Enron. I need your help with all Enron organizations to&#10;make sure that they use Dave as the focal point. If folks continue to go&#10;around him, situations like EBS will continue. He has to have the total&#10;picture of business transactions happening at Enron. He will understand how&#10;those situations can impact the business at and for Enron.&#10;&#10;Secondly, attached is the information that I received regarding contracts&#10;with Enron. Regarding the Power/Gas contact it is a 5-year deal with the&#10;sixth year being optional. The annual outlay is estimated to be $16.1M per&#10;year. I did make an error in using the $97M divided 5 years versus 6 years.&#10;So at 5 years the value is $80.5M. If you have something different, let&apos;s&#10;make sure that we are on the same page. I have attached the emails that I&#10;received this data from.&#10;&#10; &lt;&lt;RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;RE: Enron Building&#10;Services Novi MI.&gt;&gt;&#10;&#10;Regarding the EBS deal, from a business perspective we need to do a level&#10;set very quickly. Compaq wants to get this settled and move on in a positive&#10;light. Compaq will honor it&apos;s commitments but we need to make sure that&#10;Enron does the same. The bottom line is there needs to be a resetting of&#10;expectations relative to Compaq&apos;s revenue from EBS versus what actually got&#10;booked. Our expectations were $96M a year based on the forecast provided by&#10;EBS, certainly not $14M (based on what we agreed to yesterday). I find it&#10;very difficult in the spirit of partnership to hear that we are being held&#10;accountable for our portion of the deal, when we don&apos;t have the revenue to&#10;off set it. Based on what I have heard, both parties had shortcomings based&#10;on expectations that were set. I will speak to Keith and Rob this morning to&#10;see how it was left. I also need to get your perspective on the&#10;transaction. Jennifer, if there is a business opportunity, Compaq certainly&#10;wants to continue in pursuing that with Enron. Provided it&apos;s equitable for&#10;both sides. I realized that this is a difficult situation, but we will get&#10;through it.&#10;&#10;&#10;Jennifer, once again I appreciate your efforts in setting the meeting up and&#10;hosting Compaq. I will contact you later today.&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;&#10;Bob Jordan&#10;Rio Grande Area Director&#10;Compaq Computer Corporation&#10;&#10;Tele #281-927-6350&#10;Fax #281-514-7220&#10;Bob.Jordan@Compaq.com&#10;&#10;&#10;Message-ID: &lt;C34EB66A4168D211984900805FBEF6A6069BDA22@EXCHOU-NAFD04&gt;&#10;From: &quot;Earle, Jerry&quot; &lt;Jerry.Earle@COMPAQ.com&gt;&#10;To: &quot;Fiore, Michael&quot; &lt;Michael.Fiore@compaq.com&gt;&#10;Cc: &quot;Leach, Renee&quot; &lt;Renee.Leach@COMPAQ.com&gt;, &quot;Jordan, Bob&quot; &#10;&lt;Bob.Jordan@COMPAQ.com&gt;, &quot;Spurlin, David&quot; &lt;David.Spurlin@COMPAQ.com&gt;, &#10;&quot;Gooden, Jeff&quot; &lt;Jeff.Gooden@COMPAQ.com&gt;&#10;Subject: RE: Enron Energy Management Contract - Update.&#10;Date: Tue, 19 Sep 2000 14:29:34 -0600&#10;Sensitivity: Company-Confidential&#10;MIME-Version: 1.0&#10;X-Mailer: Internet Mail Service (5.5.2652.78)&#10;Content-Type: text/plain; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;&#10;&#10;Michael and Renee,&#10; This is great news.

Enron Building Services&#10;is the current service provider for Office Services related support. The&#10;proposed pricing received by Pitney Bowes is 11.1% or $15,147 lower than the&#10;price provided by Enron. Enron has been given the opportunity to revise&#10;their pricing but has chose not to. The recommendation is to award the&#10;business to Pitney Bowes. Please confirm that you concur with our&#10;recommendation. Thanks.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;----------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;------------&#10; Background: Enron Building Services was&#10;providing a facility manager, shipper receiver, receptionist and admin/help&#10;desk support for Compaq&apos;s Novi, MI site. Compaq recently chose to hire the&#10;facility manager as a permanent Compaq employee. Enron Building Services&#10;provided Compaq with revised pricing to reflect the modified scope of work.&#10;The pricing provided by Enron was 11.1% higher than the price received by&#10;Pitney Bowes. The Enron account team has been informed that their pricing&#10;is not competitive and they been given the opportunity to lower their price.&#10;They have opted not to lower the price. The recommendation of both Real&#10;Estate and Procurement is to award the business to Pitney Bowes.&#10;&#10;&#10; Enron Building Services Current Cost:&#10;&#10; Base cost for services was&#10;$190,198.00&#10; Admin/Help Desk&#10;$44,787.00&#10; Ship/Rec&#10;$35,521.00&#10; Receptionist&#10;$38,610.00&#10; Facilities Manager&#10;$71,280.00&#10; Mail Van/Car (remote site&#10;support) $13,030.00&#10; Management Fee&#10;$14,210.00&#10; Total Cost&#10;$216,438.00&#10;&#10; Compaq hired the facility manager as a&#10;badged employee.&#10;&#10; Enron Building Services Proposed Cost:&#10;&#10; Base cost for remaining services&#10;$128,071.00&#10; Admin/Help Desk&#10;$53,940.00&#10; Ship/Rec&#10;$35,521.00&#10; Receptionist&#10;$38,610.00&#10; Mail Van/Car (deleted)&#10; Management Fee&#10;$8,324.00&#10; Total Cost&#10;$136,395.00&#10;&#10;&#10; Issue: 20% increase in Admin/Help desk&#10;cost.&#10;&#10; Pitney Bowes has submitted a proposal to&#10;provide Admin/Help Desk coverage, Shipper/Receiver, Receptionist for a total&#10;cost of. $121,248.00 which is 11.1% less than EBS proposal.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Regards,&#10;&#10; Michael Fiore&#10; General Procurement&#10; Procurement Manager REOS &amp; Telecom&#10; Compaq Computer Corporation&#10; PH: (281) 514-1399&#10; Fax: (281) 514-0686&#10; michael.fiore@compaq.com&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Per your &#10;request, the HP presentation complete with a listing of HP&apos;s business &#10;partners was e-mailed to you this morning.&#10;&#10;HP contacts to date: &#10;&#10;Bill Lovejoy, Western Gulf Area Sales Manager&#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5587&#10;(Gerry Cashiola&apos;s boss)&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola, sales representative &#10;Houston, TX&#10;#(713)-439-5555&#10;(To date, HP person coordinating the relationship--seeking a short term play)&#10;&#10;Greg Pyle, Solution Control Manager&#10;Southeast Region&#10;Austin, TX &#10;(#(512)-257-5735&#10;(Pyle has been playing the business developer role but continues to defer &#10;leadership of the process to Gerry Cashiola)&#10;&#10;Daniel Morgridge, Manager of Internet - E-Services long term alliances&#10;Austin, TX&#10;#(512)-257-5736&#10;(Interested in E-services/wireless longer term alliances)&#10;&#10;Bill Dwyer, Chief Architect, e-Services Solutions&#10;Cupertino, CA&#10;#(408)-447-5240&#10;(To date, clearly the most knowledgeable person on HP&apos;s business &#10;propositions; strong technical, financial background to craft value &#10;propositions. Gerry Cashiola and Greg Pyle deferred to his judgement in the &#10;11/16th meeting)&#10;&#10;Matt,&#10; &#10;On November 10th, GSS Business Development took HP through a tour of Enron&apos;s &#10;trading floor, the gas control center, and the peaking power plant unit &#10;center on the trading floor. This tour was one meeting, amongst several, &#10;held in October and November to provide HP a full overview of Enron&apos;s &#10;products and services and introduce them to appropriate contacts at Enron &#10;(EBS, GSS buy side -- Peter Goebel).&#10;&#10;On November 16th GSS Business Development, Patrick Tucker, and Dale Clark &#10;outlined 3 possible EBS/HP focus areas -- connectivity, storage, and &#10;wireless. Three EBS action items were defined in that meeting:&#10;&#10;1) HP was to provide an HP contact on connectivity (to date, Gerry Cashiola &#10;has stalled on providing this). Sarah-Joy will continue to pursue this &#10;information and get a sense from Gerry Cashiola of what he means by short &#10;term opportunity. What is HP&apos;s time horizon for short term?&#10;&#10;2) EBS and GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call on Storage with Ravi to &#10;explore size and potential scope of opportunity (completed 12/8)&#10;&#10;3) GSS/BD was to facilitate a conference call with Peter Goebel, GSS IT &#10;Sourcing Portfolio Leader (set for 12/14) &#10;&#10;In conversations with you, Jennifer Medcalf and myself this morning, several &#10;decisions on forward-looking strategy with HP/EBS were confirmed:&#10;&#10;&#10;Gerry Cashiola has been unable to take control of the process. More &#10;importantly, despite numerous visits to Enron in which he has had overviews &#10;of Enron&apos;s products and services; met with Peter Goebel and his team on the &#10;GSS buy side, and participated in an Experience Enron tour, Gerry has been &#10;unable to define an HP business proposition. The coordination between &#10;Cashiola (short term initiative) Morgridge (long term, 12-24 months) has &#10;remained unorganized. These initiatives need to be developed separately.&#10;&#10;&#10;Clearly, the conversations with HP need to be elevated to a more senior &#10;level so EBS can work with HP decision makers who can move the relationship &#10;forward at a strategic level. As the relationship is developed at this &#10;strategic level, shorter term opportunities will crop up along the way. But &#10;Gerry&apos;s short term plans will not be the focus of the EBS/HP relationship, &#10;rather a by-product. To facilitate this process of elevating the &#10;relationship, Jennifer Medcalf and I are following up with Bill Lovejoy and &#10;Greg Pyle. Lovejoy&apos;s boss is Dan Sytsma, VP of HP&apos;s America&apos;s Central &#10;Region.&#10;&#10; In the conference call Thursday, 12/14 with Peter Goebel and HP regarding &#10;wireless initiatives, Peter will support the GSS/BD push for the HP/EBS &#10;initiative by reiterating the following two points: &#10;&#10; a) Enron is already an HP customer; the onus is on HP to move forward on &#10;the process of building a strategic relationship (IBM and Lexmark are only &#10;some of the HP competitors who could push them out of the running)&#10;&#10; b) HP&apos;s ability to bring the right people to the table will influence HP&apos;s &#10;business relationship process with Enron&#10;&#10; Patrick Tucker and Dale Clark could build their relationship with Bill &#10;Dwyer, Chief Architect e-Services Solutions, (met at the meeting 11/16) in &#10;the near term. Perhaps, plan a visit to Cupertino, California to see Dwyer &#10;in person. &#10;&#10;&#10;We look forward to continuing close collaboration with your team on this and &#10;other opportunities. &#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing - Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

After some quick&#10;analysis it looks like we overestimated the opportunity.&#10;&#10;The circuits Dietmar is requesting is a european E1 which equates to a US&#10;T1.&#10;The hub (Wallfdorf) -and-spoke (Hungary, Netherlands, UK) model SAP requires&#10;works out to roughly a $2.09M deal.&#10;&#10;Clearly this is smaller than both parties would prefer.Thus we would like to&#10;know if there are growth plans for one or more of these connections so that&#10;we&#10;can we propose a larger pipe (i.e. European E3/US DS3).&#10;&#10;For example if just one of the connections can be an E3 for the entire&#10;contract&#10;(ten years) it would bump the value up to $8.5M.

Another model to consider would be to&#10;progressively&#10;bump up the pipe size across all the connections at set intervals (i.e.&#10;years&#10;1-3 = E1, years 4-6 = E2, years 7-10 = E3).&#10;&#10;Please let me know what your thoughts are and let&apos;s talk ASAP.&#10;&#10;-------------------------------------------------------------&#10;Gary Waxman&#10;Director, Enterprise Group&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;2100 SW River Parkway&#10;Portland, OR 97201&#10;Mobile: 503-807-8923&#10;Desk: 503-886-0196&#10;Fax: 503-886-0441&#10;-------------------------------------------------------------&#10;&#10;&#10;|--------+-----------------------&gt;&#10;| | curtis.meyer@|&#10;| | sap.com |&#10;| | |&#10;| | 12/08/00 |&#10;| | 09:54 AM |&#10;| | |&#10;|--------+-----------------------&gt;&#10;&#10;&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;-|&#10; |&#10;|&#10; | To: Gary Waxman/Enron Communications@Enron Communications&#10;|&#10; | cc: dennis.gooden@sap.com, michael.bannon@sap.com&#10;|&#10; | Subject: SAP information for your proposal&#10;|&#10;&#10;&gt;---------------------------------------------------------------------------&#10;-|&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Basically, the testing is not fully &#10;completed, even where we might have felt that it was close (because there is &#10;also a financial component which needs to be exercised - the TCO part of the &#10;purchase decision). As you know, both Randy Matson and Bob McAuliffe are out &#10;on vacation, so getting a decision from them is not likely before Christmas. &#10;However, it looks like there has been enough feedback to/through them to &#10;surmise that BMC is not in the driver&apos;s seat in either situation.&#10;&#10;In a meeting today, it became apparent that BMC&apos;s revenue opportunity with &#10;the Net Works organization is much lower than BMC has projected to you at &#10;EBS. The primary opportunity for BMC in Net Works is for their Schema &#10;Manager tool, and the rest of the opportunities look increasingly dim, &#10;especially given the time constraints imposed in your situation. &#10;&#10;Still, the Net Works team has not completely ruled BMC out as a potential &#10;vendor; but neither is there a commitment (written OR verbal) to make a BMC &#10;purchase at this point. I will be on vacation next week, but will be &#10;checking in on Monday the 18th and Tuesday the 19th. Jennifer or I will keep &#10;you posted if we are able to report opportunity changes in your favor.&#10;&#10;I have sent you a paraphrased version of Doug&apos;s most recent communication to &#10;me. The overall message would apply fairly universally to the other Net &#10;Works teams in question: more testing, but looks like BMC&apos;s total sales &#10;opportunity to Enron is not going to get to the amount necessary to get your &#10;deal done. The issues mentioned in the other summary update note from &#10;yesterday still apply.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 12/15/2000 05:15 PM -----&#10;&#10; Douglas Cummins@ECT&#10; 12/15/2000 04:14 PM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: Re: BMC Summary to-date&#10;&#10;Jeff,&#10;&#10;We backed away from Patrol for monitoring - we feel that a competitor&apos;s &#10;solution is a better one for us.&#10;&#10;My group still considers BMC&apos;s Schema Manager tool to be an excellent &#10;product, and would consider it to be a viable option for purchase. I believe &#10;Net Works will still evaluate more similar tools, and related design tools, &#10;before making a decision.&#10;&#10;Regards,&#10;Douglas&#10;</body></mail>

I had the agenda discussion items and guided the &#10;conversation. The call was brief and enabled HP and Peter G. to discuss &#10;wireless initiatives briefly. Then Peter G. literally read from my notes the &#10;&quot;message&quot; you gave him about the need for HP to support the process on both &#10;the buy and sell sides. &#10;&#10;The call went well, message was delivered and Darrin will follow up with HP &#10;so they can come in to Enron and present the wireless intiative.&#10;&#10;Greg Pyle and Bill Lovejoy (but not Gerry Cashiola) were on the call. Greg &#10;Pyle made a note of saying that HP realized that they were going to have to &#10;fully support the process on both the buy and sell sides.&#10;&#10;I will still connect back with Greg Pyle by phone.&#10;&#10;SJ&#10; -----Original Message-----&#10;From: Medcalf, Jennifer &#10;Sent: Monday, December 18, 2000 8:40 AM&#10;To: Hunter, Sarah-joy&#10;Subject: Re: FW: Fedex and other cross sells UPDATE&#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy,&#10;I would contact Greg Pyle and find out what took place on the conference call.&#10;Have a Happy and safe Christmas!&#10;Jennifer&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Sarah-joy Hunter/ENRON@enronXgate 12/18/2000 08:40 AM To: Jennifer &#10;Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Subject: FW: Fedex and other cross sells UPDATE&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Jennifer:&#10;&#10;In my absence, the only issues I expect to arise are the Fedex and HP deals.&#10;&#10;For FEDEX: (cross sell) I will be speaking with Buck McGugan, VP of sales, &#10;Carmen Perez&apos;s boss&apos;s boss this morning at his office in Chicago. &#10;847-215-4241. This is a follow up call to the calls from different Fedex &#10;business units which I have received.&#10;&#10;(buy side--John Will) I forwarded John&apos;s latest update earlier this week &#10;then his note below. First, he had several conference calls with George &#10;Wasaff to John Pattillo. John Pattillo had committed to getting back to John &#10;on Friday (he didn&apos;t) with the specifics of ABS&apos; counter offer to FEDEX. &#10;John&apos;s e-mail below notes that on Friday 12/15 by noon he heard nothing back &#10;from Pattillo. Second, John is to hear back from Carmen Perez today, Fedex &#10;account rep, on any news from Fedex lawyers and team regarding Fedex&apos;s &#10;response to lawsuit issue update. Third, George Wasaff has made himself &#10;available to fly to Memphis with John this week if necessary and if this will &#10;help resolve the lawsuit issue in our favor. Fourth, John has been told to &#10;begin to pull back business from FEDEX in terms of the GSS contractual &#10;relationship. I&apos;ve asked John to keep us in the loop on the developments &#10;with these four items and what he finally decides to do 12/22 on the Fedex &#10;account.&#10;&#10;HP: Wireless conference call with Peter G. went fine. Peter G. has asked &#10;Darrin to set up a follow up meeting with HP after 1/8/01 when the Enron &#10;wireless team returns from London. This is in progress. EFS/Datawarehouse &#10;equipment meeting set for early Jan. Spoke with Peter G.&#10;&#10;I spoke with Bill Dwyer directly last week and he would welcome the &#10;opportunity to work more closely with Enron but would want to work in concert &#10;with the sales force. My e-mailed question to you was as follows: Do we &#10;just wait to hear back from Greg Pyle given your phone call to him and Peter &#10;G. message delivered to him on 12/14?&#10;&#10;&#10;Kinko&apos;s: Connected Mike Rabon to Kinko&apos;s CIO via conference call. That &#10;enables the EBS proposition to move forward with Kinko&apos;s. Also, connected Ed &#10;Quinn and Chris Charbonneau to VP of purchasing. He is the initial decision &#10;maker. Chris Charbonneau and I got on a follow up conference call with VP of &#10;Purchasing and found that he had already received a business proposition from &#10;EIM Pulp &amp; Paper team 9 months ago. But, the offer was not as competitive as &#10;the options offered by the Kinko&apos;s paper mills. Ed and Chris have some &#10;homework to do to improve the offer and get back to the VP of Purchasing. &#10;Once we get past this initial hurdle, I will work with Quinn and Charbonneau &#10;on getting to the CFO&apos;s office as necessary. So, both sides are moving &#10;foward here.&#10;&#10;Also, had Ed Quinn meet with Craig Brown and Tracy F. on office automation &#10;(pulled Jeff Youngflesh up to speed as well) since he couldn&apos;t attend the &#10;meeting. Ed had some great ideas for the process.&#10;&#10;&#10;Continental: Wasaff will speak briefly with Ron Howard on Wednesday at 1:30 &#10;PM as a follow up thank-you. Meeting minutes sent out. Will be working with &#10;Craig Breslau and T. Ramsey in early Jan. meeting to get info. needed for &#10;airline ticket for fuel mgt. swap deal going. Also, followup up with Tawney, &#10;Taylor, and Engberg (plastics) in early Jan. Plastics will also be coming to &#10;GSS/BD to give educational overview.&#10;&#10;CSC, Sonoco, Instromet followup in Jan. 2001.&#10;&#10;Have a great holiday!

Everett, I am asking for your input as &#10;it is your cost center that purchases the Compaq servers and hence one of the &#10;relationship owners. During the meeting yesterday - the following happened :&#10; a) Keith McAuliffe announced that he is leaving Compaq effective immediately &#10;(his replacement has yet to be named). My perception is that Keith took the &#10;hit for Compaq missing their 4th quarter Server Business Unit sales &#10;projections. EBS is not their only account who did not meet projected &#10;targets. &#10; b) Bob Jordan - Director NA Sales reporting to Jerry Earle will expand his &#10;existing Enron sales relationship to include ownership of the EBS Server &#10;Agreement &#10; c) EBS Server Agreement - Under the agreement Compaq was to buy EBS &#10;Services. For the first two quarters - the Compaq purchase amount was fixed &#10;at $1.72 million and starting with the third month then would be based on an &#10;8% value of the total EBS Server spend for the prior two quarters. EBS sent &#10;Compaq an invoice for $4,134,229 on November 7th. Compaq has not paid the &#10;invoice. Lou Casari&apos;s team is handling the delinquency and notifying &#10;Compaq. Compaq ( Keith M.&apos;s stewardship) had agreed to pay. Bob stated that &#10;EBS has not performed to Compaq&apos;s satisfaction under the Server Agreement and &#10;Compaq does not believe that Compaq should be accountable to buy any EBS &#10;services (Bob&apos;s first negotiation position). &#10; d) EBS and Compaq have different viewpoints on what should be included in &#10;the EBS Server Spend amount. &#10; Compaq (Bob Jordan) value - EBS purchase of $5.1 million for servers and &#10;hardware in 2000&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase value would add an additional $1.0 million &#10;for servers and hardware in 2000&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $4.9 million for servers and hardware in &#10;1999&#10; EBS (added) - EBS purchase of $3.1 million in Compaq professional &#10;services (costs for Server deployment)&#10;&#10; From these viewpoints - if one was to set a Compaq purchase amount then the &#10;following might occur&#10; EBS total is $14.1 million spend for 1999/2000 at 8% would equal a Compaq &#10;purchase amount of $1.128 million (w/out the 2 fixed quarters)&#10; Compaq total is $5.1 million spend at 8% would equal a Compaq purchase &#10;amount of $408,000&#10; EBS Viewpoint - Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - the amount &#10;is $4,134,229. (I did not concede) &#10;&#10; e) 2000 income. Per the signed EBS Server Purchase Agreement - Compaq had &#10;to pay for the Compaq Purchase amount before or by Dec 31, 2000 but could &#10;defer identifying the services to be used against the amount until Dec 31, &#10;2002. If Compaq had not used the services by Dec 31, 2002 then they lost the &#10;right to spend against the amount. To gain 2000 income recognition, EBS &#10;worked with Keith M and Rob Senders to invoice for $832,000 to cover EBS &#10;consulting services provided to Compaq. Again, under Keith M&apos;s stewardship &#10;- they verbally agreed to pay. &#10;&#10;Now with the above information - my offered next steps :&#10; a) Until everything is done - maintain the &quot;stick&quot; of the EBS invoice ($4.1 &#10;million). This is being done.&#10; b) Termination fee - the contract does not state a termination fee. It &#10;does state a value of $2.5 million max for liquidated damages. Prior &#10;conversations have discussed Compaq paying a $2.5 million termination fee &#10;(again with Keith M). This could be recognized as yr 2000 income. &#10; c) Consulting Fee - The recognition of the $832,000 would be a 20% return on &#10;services of $4.1 million. This is a good return for a commodity &#10;transaction. So.... do we accept a lower amount to maintain a healthier &#10;relationship. &#10;&#10; So...... please let me know your thougths. We have countered with the $2.5 &#10;million with the understanding that the lower end would be $832,000. &#10;&#10;Please let me know your thoughts&#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

We would &#10;appreciate your answers to a couple of questions below.&#10;&#10;Background:&#10;&#10;Ron Howard, Vice President, Continental Food Services, met earlier this year &#10;with George Wasaff, Managing Director, Enron Corporation Global Strategic &#10;Sourcing and Tracy Ramsey, Sourcing Portfolio Leader, to review the strong &#10;business relationship in fuel management and travel services which Enron has &#10;had with Continental Airlines. Discussions were held as to how this &#10;relationship could be expanded favorably for both companies.&#10;&#10;A subsequent meeting held October 25th enabled decision makers from both &#10;companies to act on these earlier discussions and explore opportunities to &#10;expand beyond the current fuel management and travel initiatives to those in &#10;weather derivatives and plastics hedging.&#10;&#10;December 11th Meeting Purpose: Follow-up from October 25th meeting to &#10;specifically address Larry Kellner (who could not make the October 25th &#10;meeting) on three initiatives in order of $ magnitude: (1) fuel management, &#10;(2) weather derivatives, and (3) plastics hedging -- VaR analysis.&#10;&#10;Location: Larry Kellner&apos;s office will be getting back to us regarding his &#10;availability to do a quick tour of the trading floor. If he can make it for &#10;a trading floor tour Kellner would meet at Enron Corporation; otherwise, he &#10;is requesting that Enron Executives meet in his executive offices at 1600 &#10;Smith Street. Is either location fine for you or do you have a specific &#10;preference?&#10;&#10;Meeting Attendees from Continental Airlines:&#10;&#10;Ron Howard, Vice President, Food Services&#10;Larry Kellner, Chief Financial Officer&#10;Greg Hartford, Vice President, Fuel Management Company&#10;Jeff Misner, Vice President and Treasurer (tentative)&#10;&#10;Mr. Shankman, who would you like to have at the meeting from Enron? To date, &#10;we have coordinated through John Nowlan. At the October 25th meeting, Alan &#10;Engberg and Mark Tawney presented the plastics hedging and weather &#10;derivatives opportunities, respectively. &#10;&#10;Next week, I will be forwarding a short briefing which outlines Enron&apos;s &#10;current relationship with Continental in fuel management and the proposed &#10;initiatives in both weather derivatives and plastics hedging. Larry &#10;Gagliardi, Craig Breslau, Alan Engberg, and Gary Taylor are all providing &#10;input on this.&#10;&#10;Sarah-Joy Hunter&#10;Enron Corporation&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing -- Business Development&#10;#(713)-345-6541&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

My &#10;message is to inform her of our movement of significant corporate office &#10;business beginning today. I have every expecation that Carmen will call me &#10;back this afternoon. Since the discussions aren&apos;t happening, I doubt that we &#10;will be flying to Memphis, but I&apos;ll advise of any changes as they occur.&#10;&#10;&#10;Also, thanks for leaving voicemail/e-mail messages to keep me in the loop &#10;regarding:&#10;&#10;a) John Pattillo&apos;s decision 12/14;&#10;b) Carmen&apos;s feedback by close of business Monday 12/18&#10;c) what you finally decide to do before leaving for the holidays 12/22&#10;d) if you follow up on George Wasaff&apos;s offer to fly to Memphis next week if &#10;necessary&#10;and e) if you need to pull back on Enron&apos;s contracts with Fedex.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Sarah-joy Hunter/ENRON@enronXgate&#10; 12/18/2000 08:42 AM&#10; &#10; To: John Will/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: Jennifer Medcalf/NA/Enron@Enron&#10; Subject: FW: Fedex&#10;&#10;John:&#10;&#10;Since this message Friday at noon, have you heard anything back from John &#10;Pattillo?

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities &#10;(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together. &#10;After our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin &#10;as the point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from &#10;Compaq to direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith &#10;McAuliffe or Kent Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending &#10;additional time with David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business &#10;opportunities and issues. &#10;&#10;EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop &#10;the streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th &#10;meeting that there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product &#10;and Server Supply Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media &#10;solutions. EBS and Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the &#10;intent of the Product and Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these &#10;solutions. To that end, EBS has had internal discussions regarding the &#10;appropriate next steps to further our relationship. &#10;&#10;The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework &#10;for our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until &#10;those changes are made:&#10;1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq &#10;was invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November &#10;7, 2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice &#10;amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section 3.0 &#10;on or before December 31,2000. &#10;2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting, &#10;Compaq (Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). &#10;The understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written &#10;notice and payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a &#10;new contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. &#10;EBS strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if &#10;Compaq believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we &#10;look forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal. &#10;&#10;Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create &#10;strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq. &#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354</body></mail>

In the past, EBS had included David on &#10;the direction of our relationship and not the details. Our prior direction &#10;was to have Derrick Deakins as our key point of communication. &#10;&#10;In regards to your comment about amending the Agreement. I would like to &#10;fill yourself, David and Bob in on some history. During the meetings in &#10;August 2000, EBS and Compaq reviewed the Agreement line by line and &#10;identified 5 sections to be clarified / amended. There was a group of at &#10;least 8 Compaq attendees (Chris Sweet took extensive notes for Compaq). Both &#10;EBS and Compaq agreed on the methodology to calculate the value of the Compaq &#10;Minimum Annual Spend of EBS Services. Spreadsheets were exchanged between &#10;both Parties and the amounts were agreed upon. A significant amount of time &#10;was spent in this process between August through October. EBS and Compaq &#10;(Derrick Deakins) developed contract language to clarify the outstanding 5 &#10;sections. This contract amendment was sent to Compaq (Rob and Derrick) for &#10;comments in November. EBS has not heard anything regarding the language. &#10;During the course of these discussions, EBS agreed to concede on certain &#10;points of interpretation on the Server Purchase Agreement and Compaq agreed &#10;to work with EBS to achieve revenue recognition in 2000. The EBS &#10;concessions were used by both Parties to develop the methodology to calculate &#10;the Compaq Minimum Spend toward EBS Services. This was reason for the &#10;development of the EBS Consulting Payment ($832,000). &#10;&#10;EBS looks forward to the resolution of these issues and moving forward with &#10;our relationship.&#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Jeff.Gooden@compaq.com&#10; 12/18/00 07:58 PM&#10; &#10; To: Kim Godfrey/Enron Communications@Enron Communications&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: RE: Compaq / EBS Relationship &#10;&#10;Kim,&#10;&#10;Thank you for including me in this email...I agree, without question, Dave&#10;Spurlin &quot;Owns&quot; the Enron/Compaq relationship, from Compaq&apos;s perspective.&#10;All matters should go through Dave...Thank you, this will make your life&#10;easier.&#10;&#10;Although I was not in the entire meeting with yourself, Keith and Rob; My&#10;reaction was that this agreement needs to be amended to protect both Enron&#10;and Compaq.

EBS has identified potential server business opportunities&#10;(storage, streaming media) where our two organizations can work together.&#10;After&#10;our meeting on Dec 14th, EBS now understands to utilize David Spurlin as the&#10;point person for these communications. EBS had prior direction from Compaq&#10;to&#10;direct our discussions to Derrick Deakins, Rob Senders, Keith McAuliffe or&#10;Kent&#10;Major. Tracy Prater and myself look forward to spending additional time&#10;with&#10;David to ensure that he is aware of the EBS business opportunities and&#10;issues.&#10;&#10;EBS had invested significant dollars, time and energy with Compaq to develop&#10;the&#10;streaming media server solutions. We discussed during the Dec 14th meeting&#10;that&#10;there are decisions to be made regarding the existing Product and Server&#10;Supply&#10;Agreement that are contingent on those streaming media solutions. EBS and&#10;Compaq have both acted in good faith to achieve the intent of the Product&#10;and&#10;Server Supply Agreement in pursuing these solutions. To that end, EBS has&#10;had&#10;internal discussions regarding the appropriate next steps to further our&#10;relationship.&#10;&#10;The January 2000 Product and Service Supply Agreement is the legal framework&#10;for&#10;our relationship until both parties mutually agree to change. Until those&#10;changes are made:&#10;1) 2000 Compaq Annual Purchase of ECI Services: Per the Agreement, Compaq&#10;was&#10;invoiced for the 2000 Minimum Annual Purchase of ECI Services on November 7,&#10;2000 as per Sections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. Compaq had agreed to the invoice&#10;amount. EBS expects payment for the total invoice as outlined in Section&#10;3.0 on&#10;or before December 31,2000.&#10;2) Potential for Agreement Termination: Prior to the Dec 14th meeting,&#10;Compaq&#10;(Keith and Rob) have discussed this with EBS (Jim Crowder, myself). The&#10;understanding between both Parties was that EBS would need a written notice&#10;and&#10;payment by Compaq of $2,500,000. The concept to start over with a new&#10;contractual agreement was again discussed during the Dec 14th meeting. EBS&#10;strongly believes in the value of the Compaq and EBS relationship, if Compaq&#10;believes that to start over with a new agreement is necessary then we look&#10;forward to working with Compaq to achieve that goal.&#10;&#10;Again, we look forward to working with yourselves to identify and create&#10;strategic business opportunities for both EBS and Compaq.&#10;&#10;Kim Godfrey&#10;Director, Enterprise Services&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;phone : 713 345 8813&#10;cell : 713 501 8105&#10;fax: 713 853 7354&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Munson expressed that during &#10;their last few months of interaction with Enron Net Works, they have &#10;attempted to understand the exact issues and concerns which Net Works has &#10;with regard to selection/use of BMC&apos;s products. Bernie voiced that he hasn&apos;t &#10;been able to get more detail on the problems or nature of concerns that Net &#10;Works has, beyond what you and I know. The BMC account team feels that &#10;without specifics, they cannot address the issues accurately or in a timely &#10;fashion.&#10;&#10;The Enron Net Works team has expressed concern that various BMC products are &#10;not Windows 2000 certified (at least, not the ones they are focused on, and &#10;not in writing). Net Works also have some other concerns relative to the &#10;(Net Works) team&apos;s feelings that the BMC products (in some areas) &quot;...haven&apos;t &#10;kept up with the industry&quot;, and that they (Net Works) have some residual &#10;issues with the BMC account support in general. Bottom Line, expressed by &#10;Net Works, is that there is a low probability of their purchasing enough BMC &#10;software product this year to enable EBS to clinch its deal with BMC.&#10;&#10;You related Jim Crowder&apos;s suggestion related to the use of indemnification &#10;and liquidated damages clauses being implemented. Jennifer and I discussed &#10;this situation, and our meetings with your team, in context. We have a &#10;possible alternative for you to consider: perhaps EBS might provide a hedge &#10;for Net Works in the form of &quot;advance purchase&quot; of BMC product.&#10;&#10;For example, EBS is poised to buy about $1 million worth of BMC software, but &#10;needs to show BMC a firm purchase commitment for about $3 million in total &#10;Enron purchases from BMC. A way in which you could reach the $3 million mark &#10;with BMC; while also allowing the relationships between Net Works and BMC &#10;time to &quot;click&quot; might be this: EBS buys all $3 million worth of BMC &#10;software, but $1 million is used to actually take product now, and the other &#10;$2 million is used as a &quot;future purchases&quot; fund, in which EBS buys, but does &#10;not take immediate delivery of, the (remaining $2 million worth of) current &#10;software...&#10;&#10;THEN, future Enron Net Works (and any other ENE business unit) purchases of &#10;BMC software would be executed such that EBS is paid, and the software is &#10;delivered from/by BMC. That way, EBS gets its $2 million back, the other &#10;business units aren&apos;t spending any of today&apos;s dollars for product which they &#10;seem to have some concerns about (but they can get current/certified product &#10;when they need it in the future). In addition, you secure the business with &#10;BMC right now. I&apos;m sure you could also figure out how to account for the &#10;time value of money in this, so that there is further leverage advantage to &#10;you.&#10;&#10;If all else fails, you may wish to consider something like this...In the &#10;meantime, we will continue along the current path and keep you posted on &#10;progress.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716</body></mail>

It builds on &#10;Offset to Last Trade functionality.&#10;&#10;The simplified description is: It tracks two variables: Intensity(Speed) and &#10;Bias (Buy or Sell emphasis). As Intensity increases, the Spread increases. &#10;As Bias increases, the Offset increases.&#10;&#10;I&apos;ll call later to see what you think of the idea.&#10;&#10;Dave&#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;Program Criteria&#10;&#10;The formula which defines the trading decision-making program will need to &#10;work with several criteria/inputs/definitions. These might be:&#10;&#10;Intensity (Speed) - The average time between transaction attempts, regardless &#10;of whether they are buys or sells. Measured as a moving average over the last &#10;[Intensity Factor] transactions by comparing the timestamp of the transaction &#10;Tibco messages for the Product.&#10;Obviously, the lower the Intensity calculation, the higher the transaction &#10;flow. Therefore a high Intensity number indicates low transaction flow.&#10;Intensity Factor - The number of transactions to be included in the moving &#10;average Intensity calculation. A possible value for this might be [4].&#10;#Buys - The number of Buys which have occurred.&#10;#Sells - The number of Sells which have occured.&#10;Transaction Count - Could be either #Buys or #Sells (whichever last occured).}&#10;Buy Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Buy occurs.&#10;Sell Offset - The Offset value which will be applied if a Sell occurs.&#10;Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR)- The amount by which the Buy Offset should be &#10;reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount Sell Offset should be reduced if a Buy &#10;occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the &#10;ORR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be 1.&#10;Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR)- The amount by which #Buys should be &#10;reduced if a Sell occurs (or amount #Sells should be reduced if a Buy &#10;occurs). A possible value for this might be [0.3]. If the application of the &#10;TRR results in a reduction of less than 1, then the reduction shall be equal &#10;to 1.&#10;Spread Minimum - The minimum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this &#10;might be [0.04]&#10;Spread Maximum - The maximum Spread value allowed. A possible value for this &#10;might be [0.50]&#10;Offset Minimum - The minimum Offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0].&#10;Offset Maximum -The maximum offset allowed for both Buys and Sells. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0.50]&#10;Initial Offset - The Buy and Sell Offset used when the program is started&#10;Initial Spread - The Spread used when the program is started&#10;Spread-Offset Minimum - The minimum amount by which Spread must exceed &#10;Offset. Prevents a possible arbitrage opportunity for the customer. A &#10;possible value for this might be [0.01]&#10;Dead Interval - The period of time which must pass before the program will &#10;recalculate the above Criteria, if no transactions have taken place during &#10;the Dead Interval. A possible value for this might be [240] seconds.&#10;&#10;Program Outputs&#10;&#10;The program should output the following variables as a result of combining &#10;the above Criteria in a user-defined Formula:&#10;&#10;Spread (integer) - as per current Stack Manager&#10;Offset (integer) - as per current Stack Manager&#10;Suspension (boolean) - Whether or not the Product should be suspended. &#10;Normally &quot;False&quot;&#10;&#10;&#10;Program Interface and Operation Principles&#10;&#10;The user should be provided with a GUI which will allow them to define a &#10;relationship among the above Criteria, which will produce and apply the &#10;Outputs to a particular Product. This relationship would be defined with &#10;Intensity Formulas and Transaction Formulas. &#10;&#10;Every time a Transaction occurs, or a Dead Interval passes, the Criteria will &#10;be recalculated and the user-defined formulas will be reviewed by the &#10;program. If a Dead Interval passes without any transactions taking place, &#10;then Intensity = Intensity +240 and #Buys=#Buys-TRR and #Sells=#Sells-TRR and &#10;Buy Offset = Buy Offset- ORR and Sell Offset = Sell Offset - ORR. &#10;&#10;If the user-defined Formulas (see following) indicate that a change in spread &#10;should occur, then if the Offset is zero (in the case of a trade occurring) &#10;or if no trade has occured (during the passing of a Dead Interval), the &#10;system shall perform a Last Trade is Mid calculation around the last &#10;transaction, adjusting the buy and sell prices according to the new Spread &#10;value.&#10;&#10;Any adjustment to the Spread shall respect the Spread-Offset Minimum. If a &#10;reduction in the Spread should violate the Spread-Offset Minimum, then the &#10;Buy Offset (or Sell Offset, or both as appropriate) shall be reduced &#10;accordingly. Similarly, if the Offset is increased by a Transaction Formula &#10;to a level greater than the Spread, the Spread shall be increased to maintain &#10;the Spread-Offset Minimum.&#10;&#10;GUI/Formulas Example:&#10;&#10;Constants&#10;Intensity Factor: [4]&#10;Dead Interval: [240]&#10;Offset Reversion Ratio (ORR): [0.3]&#10;Transaction Reversion Ratio (TRR): [0.3]&#10;Spread Minimum [0.04]&#10;Spread Maximum [0.50]&#10;Offset Minimum [0]&#10;Offset Maximum [0.49]&#10;Spread-Offset Minimum [0.01]&#10;&#10; INPUTS OUTPUTS&#10;Intensity Formula&#10;Formula # Intensity Spread Offset Suspension&#10;S1 &gt;220 -0.01 n/a F&#10;S2 &lt;30 +0.01 n/a F&#10;S3 &lt;10 +0.02 n/a F&#10;&#10;Transaction Formula&#10;Formula # # Transactions Spread Offset Suspension&#10;V1 &lt;4 n/a -0.01 F&#10;V2 &gt;3 n/a +0.01 F&#10;V3 &gt;5 +0.01 +0.02 F&#10;V4 &gt;10 +0.02 +0.04 F&#10;V5 &gt;15 +0.04 +0.15 F&#10;V6 &gt;20 n/a n/a T&#10; &#10;Note that #Transactions would be #Buys or #Sells, as appropriate. Note also &#10;that #Buys and #Sells are not intended to be an absolute count, but rather &#10;are a moving measure of the number of buys or sells which have recently &#10;occured.&#10;&#10;In this example, all Constants and Formulae are editable by the user through &#10;the GUI.&#10;&#10;&#10;Simulation&#10;&#10;Obviously, if we want to proceed, we will want to conduct several simulations &#10;to prove concepts and evaluate responsiveness. However, to give some idea of &#10;how the above might work when a market starts to run in a particular &#10;direction, please see the attached:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Additional Features&#10;&#10;System Notifications&#10;&#10;There should be two kinds of notifications for the Robotrader, which will be &#10;similar to Stack Manager Garbage Checks: Warning and Failure levels for both &#10;Offset and Price. The warning levels will trigger a pager message. The &#10;Failure levels will trigger a pager message and the product will be &#10;automatically suspended. The Price checks will be against prices input by the &#10;trader (not relative price movements, but actual price). There should be both &#10;maximum and minimum price checks (e.g. gas is trading at $5.50. The &#10;notification levels could be $8 at the top end and $2 at the bottom end). &#10;Offset checks will only be against a maximum value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Dave&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

<mail><row>753</row><date>2000/12/12</date><from>russell.dyk@enron.com</from><to>john.arnold@enron.com</to><subj>LNG to California</subj><cc>jennifer.fraser@enron.com</cc><bcc>jennifer.fraser@enron.com</bcc><body>John,&#10;Following up on yesterday, there are two additional considerations. &#10;&#10;First, with regard to the idea of curtailing gas input at the Topock &#10;liquefaction plant, the pipeline bottleneck is actually downstream of the &#10;plant, so that wouldn&apos;t help. &#10;&#10;Second, it seems there are more of these &quot;portable pipeline&quot; units floating &#10;around than I thought. Besides the inoperable unit in Amarillo, both Transgas &#10;(in Massachusetts) and Minnigasco may have at least one. Moreover, PG&amp;E has &#10;one at the end of a long lateral line on its system just south of Sacramento. &#10;Apparently it uses it mostly to augment linepack. The specs of that unit are &#10;about 4 times higher than the Amarillo one: it puts out 400,000 cubic &#10;feet/hour (about 9.6 mmcf/d or almost one contract) at 150 psi. As I said &#10;yesterday, these units are the only way that you could get gas into the &#10;pipeline system in California. &#10;&#10;This information I got from Jeff Beale, who runs CH-IV, a small-scale LNG &#10;consultant. He said that he&apos;d had some similar calls about LNG, and also that &#10;he&apos;d be willing to help Enron source equipment if we were really interested &#10;in looking further into transporting LNG into California. &#10;&#10;Assuming that we could get a few &quot;portable pipelines&quot; and some trucks, there &#10;are five liquefaction plants that could most conveniently supply LNG:&#10;&#10;Location Owner Liquefaction Capacity (gal/day) Capacity (mmcf/d) Storage &#10;(gal) Storage (mmcf)&#10;Topock, AZ ElPaso/ALT 90,000 7.4 100,000 8.2&#10;LaPlata, CO Williams 20,000 1.64 100,000 8.2&#10;Sacramento 57,600 4.72 132,000 10.8&#10;LaBarge, WY Exxon 60,000 4.92 &#10;Evanston, WY Amoco 95,000 7.8 100,000 8.2&#10;&#10;Totals 26.48&#10;&#10;Whether these plants have spare LNG to sell us is another question. The &#10;Sacramento plant, which I mentioned yesterday, is supposedly dedicated to &#10;providing methane for laboratory purposes. The others may have contracts with &#10;LNG fleet owners. &#10;&#10;I&apos;ll check back with you later today about the outcome of your meeting. </body></mail>

Rabbi&#10;&gt;Zimmerman was the seventh president of the college, which was&#10;&gt;founded in 1875.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Paul J. Menitoff, the conference&apos;s executive vice president,&#10;&gt;said its board approved the penalty on Monday, based on a&#10;&gt;recommendation by its ethics committee, which looks into complaints&#10;&gt;about the conference&apos;s 1,700 members.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said that conference rules prevented him from&#10;&gt;discussing the case but that the board decided Rabbi Zimmerman had&#10;&gt;violated a part of the ethics code, paragraph 2A, which deals with&#10;&gt;sexual conduct.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; It is included in the section of the code on &quot;personal&#10;&gt;responsibility,&quot; which covers such matters as family life, personal&#10;&gt;honesty and finances. It calls on rabbis &quot;to be scrupulous in&#10;&gt;avoiding even the appearance of sexual misconduct, whether by&#10;&gt;taking advantage of our position with those weaker than ourselves&#10;&gt;or dependent on us or succumbing to the temptations of willing&#10;&gt;adults.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Hebrew Union, which trains men and women as rabbis and cantors and&#10;&gt;in other graduate and professional fields, has 1,500 students on&#10;&gt;campuses in Cincinnati, Los Angeles, New York and Jerusalem. Before&#10;&gt;becoming president, Rabbi Zimmerman, 58, was senior rabbi of Temple&#10;&gt;Emanu-El in Dallas from 1985 to 1995, and senior rabbi at Central&#10;&gt;Synagogue in New York, from 1972 to 1985. He is married and has&#10;&gt;four children. From 1993 to 1995, he was also the conference&apos;s&#10;&gt;president.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Zimmerman&apos;s resignation was first reported yesterday in The&#10;&gt;Cincinnati Enquirer and The Dallas Morning News.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Efforts to reach him through the college and its officials were&#10;&gt;unsuccessful. The college said it appointed its provost, Norman&#10;&gt;Cohen, as acting president and would search for a permanent&#10;&gt;replacement.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said the conference followed &quot;the same process that&#10;&gt;we&apos;d follow with any rabbi in the conference in similar&#10;&gt;circumstances.&quot; He said complaints against a rabbi are referred to&#10;&gt;and investigated by the ethics committee. Depending on that&#10;&gt;committee&apos;s findings, the conference may dismiss the complaint,&#10;&gt;privately reprimand or publicly censure a rabbi or suspendn or&#10;&gt;expel a rabbi.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Menitoff said the decision to suspend Rabbi Zimmerman was&#10;&gt;&quot;very difficult and painful for everyone involved.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Eric H. Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew&#10;&gt;Congregations, the Reform movement&apos;s synagogue organization, said&#10;&gt;Rabbi Zimmerman did not contest the findings or the judgment&#10;&gt;against him but responded to the decision &quot;with great dignity.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rabbi Yoffie said that during his tenure as president, Rabbi&#10;&gt;Zimmerman added younger scholars to the faculty and expanded the&#10;&gt;college&apos;s Los Angeles branch so much that it will begin ordaining&#10;&gt;rabbis in 2002.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Another member of the conference, Rabbi A. James Rudin, emeritus&#10;&gt;director of interreligious affairs at the American Jewish&#10;&gt;Committee, said Rabbi Zimmerman&apos;s resignation was &quot;a real loss&quot; and&#10;&gt;&quot;a shock to the movement.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Hebrew Union&apos;s chairman, Burton Lehman, praised Rabbi Zimmerman as&#10;&gt;&quot;a great, great leader.&quot; Mr. Lehman said that Rabbi Zimmerman&apos;s&#10;&gt;resignation would &quot;have an impact&quot; but that the college was strong.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; &quot;Transitionally, we&apos;ll be fine,&quot; Mr. Lehman said. &quot;We have a&#10;&gt;strong faculty that will carry this institution through this&#10;&gt;tribulation.&quot;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;The New York Times on the Web&#10;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;/-----------------------------------------------------------------\&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;Visit NYTimes.com for complete access to the&#10;&gt;most authoritative news coverage on the Web,&#10;&gt;updated throughout the day.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;Become a member today!

Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing &#10;plants for instance. switching is significant and has led to cash in the &#10;gulf expiring weak everyday. gas daily spread to prompt trading at &#10;$1....need some very cold weather to justify that. this seems to be the test &#10;of the next 3-5 days. Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management &#10;keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too &#10;many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub. unless we get some crazy &#10;prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market. &#10;&#10;funny watching the flies in the front.

There are a &#10;couple of reasons for this. &#10;&#10;First, California has a relative abundance of LNG fueling stations but only &#10;two plants capable of regasification. One serves Borrego Springs, a small, &#10;affluent desert community near San Diego. The other is dedicated to military &#10;and industrial supply near Sacramento. I spoke this morning to Applied LNG &#10;Technologies, which is based in Amarillo and has the second largest LNG truck &#10;fleet (after Transgas in Massachusetts). It shouldn&apos;t be a surprise that I &#10;was not the first to call regarding this question. While ALT&apos;s fleet is &#10;operating at capacity - trucking LNG from liquefaction plants in Wyoming and &#10;Topock, Arizona - it&apos;s serving its normal fleet customers in Southern &#10;California and Nevada, and Arizona. The Topock, AZ plant is owned jointly by &#10;ALT and El Paso, and receives gas from El Paso for liquefaction and &#10;subsequent loading onto trucks.&#10;&#10;Second, LNG trucks, unlike LNG tankers, carry an extremely small volume. The &#10;average truck carries 10,000 gallons of LNG, which translates roughly into &#10;820,000 cubic feet. ALT has about 23 vehicles so potentially one could &#10;deliver 18.8 mmcf. However, these trucks don&apos;t regasify LNG, they merely &#10;transfer it into storage. &#10;&#10;The only really viable option for putting gas into the pipeline system would &#10;be a portable pipeline unit, of which ALT has the only one (it&apos;s under &#10;repair). It can deliver high pressure gas at 1800 cubic feet/minute (2.6 &#10;mmcf/day if it runs 24 hours). It has connections for two LNG trucks at a &#10;time - one live and one backup, so it can operate continuously. In the past, &#10;ALT has used the unit to cover industrials who had a supply outage for some &#10;reason. &#10;&#10;I&apos;m going to continue gathering info on domestic LNG peakshaving plants, etc. &#10;I think the opportunity may lie more in future, more strategically located &#10;peakshaving plants rather than LNG trucking arbitrage. &#10;&#10;Please let me know if you have specific questions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

To answer your question: It is looking &#10;more and more like the week of January 8th. The meetings would be held using &#10;approximately 1.5 days of a 3-day window: the 9th, 10th, and 11th. I have &#10;input from Kim Godfrey, who is driving things on the EBS side, and I have a &#10;tentative OK from Avaya for the window of the 9th - 11th. &#10;&#10;I will want to begin getting headcount of the EBS travelers, and the day(s) &#10;which each would be attending. For example, you would probably attend both &#10;days, while some of your team would be there exclusively for the 2nd day &#10;meetings. I&apos;m not sure Jim Crowder would be at both days, but Kim G. &#10;certainly would, as would members of her origination team, including Systems &#10;Engineer(s).&#10;&#10;I will call you this week to get your input re: who from your team would be &#10;going, and for which days.&#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Larry Ciscon@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS&#10; 11/27/2000 08:31 PM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: &#10; Subject: RE: Enron / Avaya meetings: calendar&#10;&#10;Jeff,&#10;&#10;What&apos;s the current plan on this meeting?

EBS sell with, &#10;and/or through the Avaya sales organization&#10;&#10;&#10;The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS &#10;development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: &#10;1) results of the executive meetings&apos; output from 1&amp;2 above, &#10;discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues &#10;and opportunities&#10;and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which &#10;could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions &#10; to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya&apos;s sales &amp; &#10;marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both &#10;days due to the nature of his mission.&#10;&#10;&#10;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Please let me know as soon as you can which day or &#10;days would work best for you to make the trip.

Prompt gas at $6+ and Z/F as &#10;wide as last year. Hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip. &#10;Rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango. if it &#10;couldn&apos;t do it this year....&#10;A lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that&apos;s what the curve &#10;told them to do last bid week. Obviously, more gas trying to come out than &#10;is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an &#10;Enron, to inject. Problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we&apos;re pulling &#10;it out in G. When you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, &#10;cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f. Storage &#10;economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of &#10;winter. Buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways. &#10;Agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong. storage boys &#10;are withdrawing today and buying that. bottom fishing in f/g yet or is it &#10;going to zero?&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/22/2000 06:50:46 AM&#10;To: John.Arnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: re:mkts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;agree on jan/feb-i cudnt resist sold a little yest at 39-will prob end up &#10;buying&#10;em back at +45 and piss away the rest of my month&#10;&#10;fyi-if you ever have a chance to speak on the phone feel free to call-my time &#10;is&#10;busy but managed only by me not paper flow and eol. so i dont bother you with&#10;calls just an occasional email to give you the time to respond when you have &#10;the&#10;time. im also susprised about dec/jan-mad a few bucks trading it both ways but&#10;one cant help wonder given these loads-gass crazy out west-the so called &#10;impact&#10;of husbanding by end users yet the frontn of the curve still cant backwardate &#10;at&#10;all-indeed makes all the sprds look very rich agaon.&#10; also will be curious how these &quot;loan deals&quot; by pipes work ouut. man these&#10;guys cud really be getting themselves in trouble-another big reason dec cash&#10;hasnt been able to go over jan-but i think it will make them strong longs in &#10;the&#10;back of the mkt?? ie are they taking the gas back in march, april?? shud keep&#10;that part of the curve very strong agree?&#10; be cool my man-talk later&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

This time can be reduced to as less as 1 second. &#10;However, I would not recommend to reduce the time interval less than 10 &#10;second.

Spreads definitely &#10;implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter. &#10;Hell, already seeing it in the West. The system is just broken there. &#10;interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later. &#10;definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won&apos;t occur until &#10;latter part of the winter. the inelasticity of demand continues to be &#10;unbelievable. who would have thunk it. Gas can be 3 times what it was one &#10;year ago and not a significant loss of demand. &#10;market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point. continues to be a &#10;very trending market. most days finish on the intraday high or low. &#10;Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been &#10;significant. i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day. understand they &#10;are changing their view somewhat tomorrow. wait and see if it relieves some &#10;back pressure. very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5 &#10;considering the scenario that&apos;s being painted. &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;slafontaine@globalp.com on 11/21/2000 01:06:40 PM&#10;To: jarnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: re:mkts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;johnny, hope things re treating you well. this month has been frustrating for&#10;me-generally caught many mkt moves but had 2 postions that nearly cancelled &#10;all&#10;the rest. im finding it really really hard to assess risk now in oil and gas&#10;therefore im taking a step back esp in front of holidays and year end. was &#10;long&#10;mar gas vs backs which worked great but i took profits waayyy too early&#10; flat px i think is pretty clear-if weather stays normal to below we keep a&#10;flaoor at 5.80-6.00 bucks for another 40 days at least. if we have sustained&#10;aboves we drop like a rock in part due to back en d pressure.&#10;&#10; but spreads-what the hell do we do with em?????????? was just saying to &#10;mark&#10;silverman there is a huge opportunity here staring us in the face but i hve no&#10;idea what it is-i have equal arguements for why sprds shud fall or move out. &#10;any&#10;great insites? hope all is well and enjoy the long weeknd-we both deserve it.&#10; guess the curve will stop blowing out when/if we see the back end selling &#10;dry&#10;up??&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

I would like to forward this on to James &#10;Thompson to assist him in targeting the right person for us to work with (and &#10;cc Mike Rabon). Is this a good idea to forward on the e-mail or is it &#10;overkill given the e-mail I sent yesterday? Second, could I mention &quot;Gary &#10;King&quot; Mike Rabon&apos;s Kinko&apos;s contact in the e-mail?&#10;&#10;Thanks for your suggestion! SJ&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Mr. Thompson:&#10;&#10;Here are several &quot;touchpoints&quot; identified by Mike Rabon, the Enron Broadband &#10;Services originator, which may facilitate your finding the appropriate &#10;broadband solutions architect at Kinko&apos;s. You may recall having met Mike &#10;Rabon in the October 6th meeting. &#10;&#10;Kinko&apos;s has an IP network today with access to all branches. Kinko&apos;s had &#10;expressed the need to add more hubs to that network and make some changes to &#10;it in the spring 2001 time frame. Enron&apos;s goal would be to make a needs &#10;assessment for the desired structure that Kinko&apos;s would like to see as it &#10;pertains to:&#10;Near term network planning.&#10;IP Transport - Capacity requirements for Mbps, and burst potential.&#10;IP Transit - Capacity requirements and current contract usage for internet &#10;transit. Kinkos.com in particular has a high potential for IP transit &#10;capacity.&#10;Storage - As the hubs and branch numbers grow, there may be a need for &#10;managed storage. Enron&apos;s solution will reduce, or eliminate the need to buy &#10;storage devices. Mike Rabon would like to speak with someone at Kinko&apos;s about &#10;your storage strategy and growth.&#10;Collocation - There is a substantial opportunity for Enron to provide the &#10;actual space to be used for the hubs, as well as the IP transport from the &#10;hubs.&#10;Interactive Video - Enron&apos;s IPNet Connect product will allow high quality &#10;H.323 video conferencing at bandwidths well above 768K. Utilizing the Enron &#10;IPNet Connect network installed to branches can allow video costs to be &#10;significantly reduced, and allow much higher video quality. Enron&apos;s &#10;utilization of IP precedence will allow business traffic, internet traffic &#10;and video traffic to traverse the same network. Mike Rabon would like to &#10;speak to the Video Conferencing product manager.&#10;Risk Management - Enron&apos;s expertise in Risk Management needs to be &#10;communicated to the proper person.&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

An example would be a deal done with KUKUI Inc. on November &#10;8th, 2000. It is booked as deal numbers Q86409.1, Q86409.2, Q86409.3, and &#10;Q86409.4. These are four separate and unique deal numbers and therefore &#10;count as a total of four deals. &#10;&#10;We understand that the trade desk may consider the deal in this example as &#10;just one large deal with 4 different parts. Unfortunately, the EOL &#10;Reporting Database has no way of telling whether or not these types of deals &#10;are distinct different deals or part of one larger deal. Since this &#10;currently can not be known, the EOL Reporting Database uses the most &#10;conservative approach and counts them all as individual deals. This results &#10;in a higher OTC deal count and thus a lower EOL percentage of all deals.&#10;&#10;If you have any further questions , please don&apos;t hesitate to ask.&#10;&#10;Pete Berzins&#10;x57597&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

I saw only one job that was posted on Enron&apos;s website that&#10;looked like a good fit. It was an asset evaluation and integration job for&#10;Enron North America: job # 0000105886.&#10;&#10;My primary strengths are:&#10;&#10;Natural gas asset acquisition and management&#10;Supporting a trading organization by providing excellent futures and&#10;derivatives execution&#10;Trading proprietary books (fixed price or otherwise)where there is a&#10;competitive reason to be in the market, i.e. transportation spreads,&#10;storage, physical presence&#10;Good customer relations/account development&#10;Ability to focus on and analyze a wide range of problems/opportunities&#10;Stong negotiator&#10;&#10;I know that Enron is a big, happening place and it is invaluble to have&#10;someone like you to help me sort out the opportunities. Where I am coming&#10;from is that I have to more valuble to Enron than I am to Oxy because Oxy is&#10;doing frustratingly little to leverage itself and Enron is setting every&#10;trend imaginable in leveraging itself.&#10;&#10;I appreciate any help you can provide.&#10;&#10;Thanks.&#10;&#10;Alan&#10;&#10;&#10;-----Original Message-----&#10;From: John.Arnold@enron.com [mailto:John.Arnold@enron.com]&#10;Sent: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 5:15 PM&#10;To: Alan_Batt@oxy.com&#10;Subject: Re: Resume&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Alan:&#10;I received your email.

When he saw it there in the&#10;parking&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;lot&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; of IHOP, he went and bought a camera to take pictures.&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; The car is still running as can be witnessed by the exhaust. A&#10;woman&#10;is&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; either asleep or otherwise out in the front seat passenger side.&#10;The&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;guy&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; driving it was over jogging up and down on Rt. 925 in the&#10;background.&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;The&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; witnesses said their physical state was OTHER than normal and the&#10;police&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; just shook their heads in amazement. The driver finally came back&#10;after&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; the police were there and was getting down at the back to cut the&#10;&apos;twine&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; around the load. They told him to get back until it was taken&#10;off.&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; The materials were loaded at Home Depot. Their store manager said&#10;they&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; had the customer sign a waiver!&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; Both back tires are trashed. The back shocks were driven up&#10;through&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;the&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; floorboard. In the back seat are 10 bags, 80 lbs. each of&#10;concrete.&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; On the roof is many 2X4s, 4X4s and OSB sheets of lumber. They&#10;estimated&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;the&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; load weight at 3000 lbs. The car is a VW Jetta with FL plates&#10;and&#10;the&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;guy&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt; said he was headed for Annapolis.&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;JUST UNBELIEVABLE!!!!&#10;&gt; &gt;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; - stupid.jpg</body></mail>

They also suggested that they had a broker that watched spreads for &#10;a commission therefore theoretically the broker was an employee of the &#10;company. After all the bull they agreed to have them shut down and they &#10;would refrain from doing it again.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

We were originally looking at the 9th, 10th, or 11th as days to &#10;choose from primarily to avoid having the EBS executives located in the &#10;western U.S. travel from Portland, OR on Sunday for meetings on Monday in &#10;NJ. Consequently, I had asked the EBS executives to pencil in the 9th - 11th &#10;of January, and got the final one to confirm late last week. &#10;&#10;However, Kim Godfrey at EBS may have some new requirements; which is why I &#10;need your help in an expedited way - I&apos;ll need to give Kim your executives&apos; &#10;availability during that week, and then we&apos;ll get things locked in ASAP.The &#10;meetings would still be scheduled such that the 1st meeting day would be for &#10;the meetings to be held during the 2nd half of that day, from 2-4 hours of &#10;meeting time for the executives (VP &amp; up, primarily) to discuss possible &#10;alignments and opportunities. This would include two primary areas:&#10;&#10;1) EBS-sell-to-Avaya for Avaya internal use: what types of potential &#10;solutions EBS could offer Avaya for Avaya&apos;s internal use; and&#10;2) EBS &amp; Avaya join together in a product and/or marketing effort to &#10;determine what kinds of solutions which the could jointly propose to the &#10;(common) markets served: &quot;sell with&quot; (each other); and &quot;sell through&quot; &#10;(channels type efforts), where either or both Avaya and EBS would act as &#10;sales channels for each other&apos;s sales forces.&#10;&#10;These meetings would be followed by the 2nd day&apos;s session(s), which would &#10;include primarily development and marketing team members who would discuss &#10;areas in which Avaya and EBS could develop one or more joint value &#10;propositions, such that they would have a &quot;jumping off point&quot; for a &#10;go-to-market effort (item #2, above). In addition, the technical aspects of &#10;some of the &#10;&quot;EBS-would-like-to-sell-its-services-to-Avaya-for-Avaya-internal-use&quot; (item &#10;#1, above) meetings from the Executive session the 1st day could then be &#10;addressed.&#10;&#10;Please let me know which 2-day period looks like the most workable one for &#10;your executives at Avaya HQ during the week of 1/8/01, so that I can get to &#10;Kim to allow her to get the EBS executives&apos; schedules locked into days &#10;synchronized with your executives&apos;. &#10;&#10;Thank you,&#10;&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;Jeff Youngflesh&#10;Director, Business Development&#10;Global Strategic Sourcing&#10;Enron Corp.&#10;333 Clay Street, 11th Floor&#10;Houston, TX 77002&#10;t: 713-345-5968&#10;f: 713-646-2450&#10;c: 713-410-6716</body></mail>

Period.&#10;&#10;7) The Result: EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net &#10;Works&apos; folks are concerned.&#10;&#10;In the &quot;I don&apos;t want any surprises&quot; mode, I thought I&apos;d give George a &#10;heads-up re: possible fallout around the BMC thing. I told George in this &#10;morning&apos;s staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team (&quot;I &#10;don&apos;t see a problem here...&quot;), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and &#10;implement $1M of BMC&apos;s stuff, pay $2M for &quot;credit&quot;, which any ENE business &#10;unit could access, etc. I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were &#10;likely to encourage Crowder to &quot;lean on&quot; Philippe (which I had recommended &#10;against). George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub. &#10;&#10;If you have any questions, please let me know.&#10;Jeff&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;----- Forwarded by Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron on 12/04/2000 10:32 AM -----&#10;&#10; Stephen Morse@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS&#10; 12/04/2000 10:04 AM&#10; &#10; To: Jeff Youngflesh/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; cc: Jennifer N Stewart/NA/Enron@ENRON&#10; Subject: FW: Win2K Certification&#10;&#10;FYI,&#10;&#10;Pls see note below from BMC Sales folks.&#10;&#10;Thanks,&#10;&#10;Steve&#10;&#10;&#10;Steve Morse&#10;Enron Broadband Services&#10;713-853-7137-work&#10;713-569-7912-cell&#10;email: stephen_morse@enron.net&#10;----- Forwarded by Stephen Morse/Enron Communications on 12/04/00 10:07 AM &#10;-----&#10;&#10; Ann_Munson@bmc.com&#10; 11/22/00 11:54 AM&#10; &#10; To: Stephen Morse/Enron Communications@Enron Communications&#10; cc: Chaz Vaughan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Joe_Young@bmc.com&#10; Subject: FW: Win2K Certification&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Here&apos;s the latest communication to Bruce Smith regarding Control-SA and&#10;Control-M Windows 2000 certification, as well as reporting on the testing.&#10;It&apos;s in the document, but to point it out, Control-SA is ready for&#10;certification process on Dec of 2000 and Control-M on March 2001.&#10;&#10;Ann M.

We have also summarized our Windows 2000 development and&#10;&gt; certification methodology which is actually a two-phase approach. The&#10;&gt; most critical phase, which ensures Win2K compatibility and support and&#10;&gt; includes customer testing, has been completed. The Win2K Agents are GA&#10;&gt; for both Control-M (scheduling) and Control-SA (security).&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; The next phase, which is also a key element of our development strategy,&#10;&gt; is to insure the products meet the certification requirements for&#10;&gt; Microsoft Win2K. This phase follows the Win2K initial release as MS&#10;&gt; Certification focuses on meeting certain Microsoft standards and not the&#10;&gt; application&apos;s functionality - ability to work correctly in the Control-M&#10;&gt; environment.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Microsoft certification does not necessarily guarantee the performance of&#10;&gt; the application. It is my understanding that one of the reasons Control-M&#10;&gt; is being considered as a replacement for sys*Admiral is due to the&#10;&gt; problems you are experiencing with their MS Certified release.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Earlier this year we met with Philippe Bibi and reviewed BMC&apos;s Win2K&#10;&gt; Development Plans. Would it be helpful to set up a similar meeting with&#10;&gt; an executive from our Product Marketing group to discuss these in more&#10;&gt; detail?&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; One final note. I just received the following update from Rusty Cheves,&#10;&gt; reconfirming that Control-M continues to run smoothly since we made the&#10;&gt; database changes.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks Rob for all the hard work last week. It seems as we have&#10;&gt; finally got this thing running smoothly. After extending the database and&#10;&gt; troubleshooting which log files were filling up we now can eval till out&#10;&gt; hearts content.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Please tell Ronnie thanks for all his help as well&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks Again&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rusty&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; As a next step, could we meet soon after the Thanksgiving Holidays? I&#10;&gt; can arrange to bring an executive from product marketing along if you&#10;&gt; would like to discuss Win2K certification in more detail.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rob&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;M&#10;&#10;&gt; Rob Hallberg&#10;&gt; BMC Software&#10;&gt; Direct: (972) 934-5073&#10;&gt; Mobile: (214) 695-2840&#10;&gt; rob_hallberg@bmc.com&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; -----Original Message-----&#10;&gt; From: Bruce.Smith@enron.com [mailto:Bruce.Smith@enron.com]&#10;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, November 21, 2000 7:14 AM&#10;&gt; To: Rob_Hallberg@bmc.com; Larry.Robinson@enron.com&#10;&gt; Subject: RE: Recap&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rob -&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Where are we with the Win2K issue ?&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; -----Original Message-----&#10;&gt; From: &quot;Hallberg, Rob&quot; &lt;Rob_Hallberg@bmc.com&gt;@ENRON&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; [mailto:IMCEANOTES-+22Hallberg+2C+20Rob+22+20+3CRob+5FHallberg+40bmc+2Ecom&#10;&gt; +3E+40ENRON@ENRON.com]&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Sent: Monday, November 20, 2000 11:20 PM&#10;&gt; To: Robinson, Larry&#10;&gt; Cc: Sapp, Ronnie; Smith, Bruce; Cheves, Rusty&#10;&gt; Subject: RE: Recap&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Hi Larry,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Following is Ronnie Sapp&apos;s summary of the problem resolution for the&#10;&gt; Control-M installation problems and the reliability and scalability&#10;&gt; results&#10;&gt; attained. It now appears that most of the problems were caused by the&#10;&gt; setup&#10;&gt; of the Oracle database.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Once we left Thursday evening and through the following day, Schedule-M&#10;&gt; worked flawlessly. The new day process was last measured taking less&#10;&gt; than&#10;&gt; five minutes for 960 jobs and we approximated job volumes 14,500 per&#10;&gt; day.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; This demonstrates the reliability and scalability of Control-M when&#10;&gt; installed properly. I will give you a call to discuss the results and&#10;&gt; our&#10;&gt; next steps.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Thanks,&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rob&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rob Hallberg&#10;&gt; BMC Software&#10;&gt; Direct: (972) 934-5073&#10;&gt; Mobile: (214) 695-2840&#10;&gt; rob_hallberg@bmc.com&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; -----Original Message-----&#10;&gt; &gt; From: Sapp, Ronnie&#10;&gt; &gt; Sent: Monday, November 20, 2000 4:16 PM&#10;&gt; &gt; To: Rob Hallberg (E-mail)&#10;&gt; &gt; Subject: FW: Recap&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Rob, will you please forward this to Larry.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Larry, Below is the recap we talked about.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Recap:&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; There were 2 outstanding issues.&#10;&gt; &gt; 1) New Day process running 2-5 hrs.&#10;&gt; &gt; 2) Jobs not running, they were all in Blue or White status.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Issue number 1 was resolved the day before I arrived by Tech Support&#10;&gt; &gt; working with Rusty. Solution was to increase the Oracle DB from 50mg&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; 300mg. Also the log &amp; stat files were extremely small. These files&#10;&gt; were&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaned out by Rusty, however were never increased or set to truncate&#10;&gt; in&#10;&gt; &gt; Oracle. They will fill up again. These files need to be set to&#10;&gt; truncate&#10;&gt; &gt; by the Oracle DBA or run a set of daily utilities to clean those&#10;&gt; files.&#10;&gt; &gt; We will send a draft of those utilities to be incorporated into the&#10;&gt; daily&#10;&gt; &gt; schedule.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Issue number 2 - According to a diagnostic report the agent machine&#10;&gt; lost&#10;&gt; &gt; connection with the NIS server for a greater period of time than what&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; default settings were set. The agent is set to retry every 120&#10;&gt; seconds up&#10;&gt; &gt; to 12 times. After this period, manual activation is required. I&#10;&gt; signed&#10;&gt; &gt; on as CTMAGENT user and ran ag_menu. Ran option 2 which showed the&#10;&gt; NIS as&#10;&gt; &gt; down. I then signed on as the Control-M user and ran ctm_menu.&#10;&gt; Selected&#10;&gt; &gt; 7 - Agent Status, Selected 2 - List all agent platforms unavailable.&#10;&gt; &gt; Agent on BMC was in unavailable status. Next Selected option 3 -&#10;&gt; Change&#10;&gt; &gt; agent platform to Available status. After doing that, all the jobs&#10;&gt; turned&#10;&gt; &gt; to gray status and started running.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Cleaned up 2 erroneous agent names defined to Control-M/Server.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I also ran a Trouble Shooting Report which produced a file&#10;&gt; &gt; (/var/home/ctlm00/report.1116001128) from this file we could tell&#10;&gt; when&#10;&gt; &gt; the Log filed filled up and when the Agent stopped.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I set up 500 jobs to run daily on BMC with multiple dependencies.&#10;&gt; All&#10;&gt; ran&#10;&gt; &gt; ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; I set up aprox. another 150 cyclic jobs with dependencies to run on&#10;&gt; &gt; OCSDEV-1. They failed due to not using the correct Owner. Rusty&#10;&gt; knows&#10;&gt; &gt; what the correct owner should be. I believed I used CTLM00.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; New Day process ran for approx. 12 mins.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Right before leaving Rusty ran a clean_db script, which resulted in&#10;&gt; &gt; cleaning out the entire database. Fortunately by design, we were&#10;&gt; able&#10;&gt; to&#10;&gt; &gt; demonstrate the recoverability by uploading the tables from ECS to&#10;&gt; the&#10;&gt; &gt; Control-M Server. In less than 5 minutes all was ok.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; When I left there were approx. 900 jobs running. Of those approx.&#10;&gt; 400&#10;&gt; &gt; jobs were running cyclic, every 2 minutes. Which meant on a daily&#10;&gt; basis&#10;&gt; &gt; approx. 14,500 jobs ran per day.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Larry, I know you asked for some type of hardware recommendations.&#10;&gt; These&#10;&gt; &gt; is something that&apos;s very subjective. As with almost any software the&#10;&gt; more&#10;&gt; &gt; memory and faster CPU the better. To do this correctly, we should&#10;&gt; have&#10;&gt; &gt; our Professional Services come in and do some type of assessment of&#10;&gt; your&#10;&gt; &gt; environment and the direction your heading. How many jobs per day,&#10;&gt; today,&#10;&gt; &gt; near future, etc.... How many Users of ECS? How many Servers?&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; In your test environment you should be able to run 2000 jobs without&#10;&gt; a&#10;&gt; &gt; major problem. Your ECS NT box is on the small size, at least in the&#10;&gt; &gt; memory area. So your responses might not be as fast as desired.&#10;&gt; Please&#10;&gt; &gt; remember the out of the box default settings are not tuned to run a&#10;&gt; large&#10;&gt; &gt; number of jobs. Therefore database tuning is always recommended.&#10;&gt; These&#10;&gt; &gt; tuning recommendations are provided by Professional Services.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; By tomorrow I will send you the daily utilities.&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Thanks,&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt; Ronnie Sapp&#10;&gt; &gt; bmcsoftware&#10;&gt; &gt; INCONTROL Business Unit&#10;&gt; &gt; Software Consultant Manager&#10;&gt; &gt; West Region&#10;&gt; &gt; 972-934-5065&#10;&gt; &gt; ronnie_sapp@bmc.com&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt; &gt;&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; - C.DTF &lt;&lt; File: C.DTF &gt;&gt;&#10;</body></mail>

It now looks as if it will get done in the &#10;next 3 weeks-1 month so we want to get all the necessary credit issues taken &#10;care of. &#10;&#10;In brief, the deal is a fixed price one, basis TCO (67% of the volumes) and &#10;CNG (33%) with a fixed price Nymex component as well. It will settle against &#10;the Inside FERC indices for both locations. The term of the deal is from &#10;December, 2000 to December 2012. The volumes decline throughout the term from &#10;roughly 22,000 mmBtu/d to 13,000 mmBtu/d. The average daily nominal volume is &#10;17,000 mmBtu/d. As I understand it, these volumes are about 65% of the &#10;producers&apos; total volumes. I&apos;ve attached a spreadsheet to this message with &#10;more details. &#10;&#10;There are a couple of contractual and credit issues that CSFB wants to &#10;clarify. &#10;&#10;First, there is a question of the monthly cash settlement. CSFB would like &#10;payment to take place on the fifteenth of the month following the date both &#10;the floating and fixed prices are known. As I understand it, for the &#10;December settlement, which would be known in early December, cash payment &#10;would take place on February 15, 2000. &#10;&#10;Second, there is a question of a parent guarantee from Enron Corp. &#10;Apparently, there is an existing credit arrangement in place between ENA and &#10;Credit Suisse First Boston International - the same counterparty that we &#10;would be dealing with here - that has a $15 million guarantee from Enron &#10;Corp. CSFB would like to increase this guarantee to at least $100 million. &#10;(CSFB already has an unlimited guarantee from Enron Corp. for a deal they&apos;ve &#10;done with us in Europe so in their opinion it should not be an issue). &#10;&#10; There is another minor issue involving centralizing credit discussions with &#10;the aim of securing a similar credit arrangement for CSFB&apos;s dealings with &#10;EnronCredit.com - which may be an issue for London rather than Houston. &#10;However, CSFB agreed that this was a secondary issue in relation to this &#10;transaction.&#10;&#10;CSFB would like to do the entire deal through us, rather than having to split &#10;it among one or more counterparties. Per, Caroline Abramo, and I are meeting &#10;with Paul tomorrow to discuss various credit issues, including this one. &#10;Ideally, CSFB would like to have a good idea of where they stand by the end &#10;of this week. &#10;&#10;Please let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.&#10;&#10;Regards,&#10;Russ&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Trading was to open at 2:00pm and we had the site up by &#10;aprox 2:15pm.&#10;&#10;I am not aware of any issues on 10/8 and 10/15.&#10;&#10;This past Sunday, 10/22 we had a problem with a release that we pushed out on &#10;Saturday.

Things are going crazy in the gas market so, &#10;unfotunately, I&apos;m stuck at my desk and can&apos;t go up for interviews. &#10;&#10;As far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview. &#10;Be confident. Answer the question asked. Don&apos;t be afraid to say you don&apos;t &#10;know but don&apos;t make excuses. Express interest in why you find Enron &#10;appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing. &#10;&#10;The trading training program is still in the works. Few people outside the &#10;trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so I wouldn&apos;t ask &#10;any questions about it in the interviews. If you receive an offer, it would &#10;probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the &#10;training program when you arrive. Not sure about that last statement &#10;though. The training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure &#10;trading business areas: gas and power. There are still a large number of &#10;other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall &#10;under the program. That&apos;s a function of the program being developed by the &#10;head of these two businesses. Not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.&#10;&#10;Write me about how your interviews went.&#10;Good luck:&#10;John&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Adam Bayer&quot; &lt;adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu&gt; on 10/19/2000 03:28:57 PM&#10;To: &lt;john.arnold@enron.com&gt;&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: How are you today&#10;&#10;&#10;Hi John,&#10;&#10;How are you today?

Light to Heavy Industrial building in Tula, Hidalgo (a&#10;&gt; well-populated industrial valley roughly 50 miles north of&#10;&gt; Mexico City). Deluxe all brick and concrete building is&#10;&gt; approximately 98,500 square feet with clear span ceiling&#10;&gt; height in excess of 30 ft. The site includes adjacent land,&#10;&gt; which would allow more than doubling the size of facility.&#10;&gt; Located in front of the PEMEX Hidalgo refinery /&#10;&gt; petrochemical plant and a Thermoelectric power generating&#10;&gt; station. Factory is equipment ready and could be in full&#10;&gt; production quickly.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 2. Housing complex built for the Tula factory supervisory&#10;&gt; personnel consists of 32 three-bedroom garden style&#10;&gt; townhouse apartments and an independent eight bedroom&#10;&gt; extended stay dormitory for engineers. In a separately&#10;&gt; enclosed compound is a 3,800 square foot deluxe residence&#10;&gt; with 4-car garage designed for the plant manager or visiting&#10;&gt; officials. The property contains appropriate recreational&#10;&gt; and sports areas for families. It is entirely gated and&#10;&gt; fully secured.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; 3. Development site City of Puebla. This highly visible 8.7&#10;&gt; acres of flat land fronts the Puebla-Mexico City&#10;&gt; superhighway at a formal exit. It is at the entrance corner&#10;&gt; to an industrial area of other trans-national manufactures.&#10;&gt; Site is located approximately 5.5 miles north of the&#10;&gt; Volkswagen assembly plant.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Prefer selling items 1 &amp; 2 as a package, but will entertain&#10;&gt; separate offers. Would also consider long term lease with a&#10;&gt; creditworthy corporate tenant.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; With respect to item 3, a build to suit, again a&#10;&gt; long-term lease with a credit worthy corporate tenant is&#10;&gt; possible.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; All properties are surplus assets and therefore very&#10;&gt; aggressively priced. Factory and housing offered at&#10;&gt; substantially below replacement cost.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; For more information on these items and other services we&#10;&gt; provide in Mexico please visit our web site.&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; http://www.MIHC.com.mx&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; In the US:&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Rick Curry&#10;&gt; General Counsel&#10;&gt; MIHC - Los Angeles&#10;&gt; PH 213-308-0300&#10;&gt; email to: RGCurry@MIHC.com.mx&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; In Mexico:&#10;&gt;&#10;&gt; Ari Feldman, CCIM, SIOR, CIPS&#10;&gt; Director General&#10;&gt; MIHC - Mexico City&#10;&gt; Phone from the US (011) (52) 5286-3458&#10;&gt; email to: AFeldman@MIHC.com.mx&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

On that subject Leonard did pass on to me that the&#10;signed contract is &quot;on the way&quot;.&#10;&#10;The purpose of this e-mail is inquire about Enron&apos;s ability to&#10;provide/supply natural gas to our company. We consume quite a bit of&#10;natural gas relatively speaking in our aluminum furnace. I believe last&#10;year we spent about $500,000.&#10;&#10;As we both know the price of natural gas is rising. It never hurts to check&#10;and see if better deals are out there. If this is of any interest, please&#10;pass on to the appropriate person/group who would handle. The can contact&#10;me first and then I will turn over to our person here.

First, in gas, you can play the seasonality &#10;game. Does anybody want to buy M/N at 1 back. No, of course not. But in &#10;crude, m/n at .10 back is normal. definitely a game as you try to keep month &#10;on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads &#10;and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is. &#10;that&apos;s why cal 2 is as high as it is. &#10;when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt &#10;month. i can&apos;t remember w/o looking at charts. it&apos;s always the mentality &#10;of: if it&apos;s tight now what about July or what about winter. i think that&apos;s &#10;why the winter spreads are a piece. the z/f/g fly is interesting. i think &#10;z/f can and will settle backw. just a high prob it goes cantango first.&#10;Still seeing sellside interest in term. definitely a result of pira. will &#10;probably get absorbed in the next two weeks as everybody forgets about them &#10;and watches the front of the curve. previous to that conference, the &#10;producers just didnt want to sell anything. tired of writing us a big check &#10;every month.&#10;so not only am i in on weekends, but they just put a computer in my house so &#10;i can work at home at night. it&apos;s really my only time to sit and think &#10;without the phones and eol going crazy. they better pay me for the decline &#10;in my lifestyle .&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;slafontaine@globalp.com on 10/15/2000 09:26:31 PM&#10;To: John.Arnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: Re: mkts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;what is a young pup like you doing working on saturday? yea ill check again &#10;the&#10;numbers but pretty sure they said +3 bcf by dec. ill let you know/its been&#10;along week/weekend of partying in ny so my memory mite be failing me. i know&#10;this isnt same as crude-less mature but getting there so im always wondering&#10;if/when the mentality will start to go more that way-ie inverses shud be for&#10;only 1 reason-that supply/demand balance will get less tite than it is today.&#10; some length has gotten out of winter sprds but i know from a few i talk &#10;too&#10;they still in-im out even slitely short not much cuz i think growing&#10;deliverabilty if it occurs is bearish the sprds-and 30 cts inverses will be &#10;hard&#10;to maintain unless we have crazy weather. we&apos;re only 2 weeks from withdrawel&#10;period so unitl i see cash backwardate im not gonna be bullish these sprds &#10;until&#10;all the length bails.&#10; your rite on the mkt-the anticipation is in the mkt-you gotta have flat px&#10;to make money,my approach in the short term as well. that said everyone at &#10;pira&#10;including pira all bull bull the winter-will be good i think for a&#10;win/sum01/win02 inverse play even tho its not cheap.&#10; fyi-pira also bearish crude-not saying they rite but will have impact on&#10;natgas producers sentiment short term-esp as mideast starts to fiad. for you &#10;be&#10;careful of the politics effecting heating oil, natgas watching too. there will&#10;be some action in my opinion next 4 weeks by govt that cud impact ho futs&#10;negatively and therefore may roll to natgas-ie if ho goes a big discount to&#10;natgas before any major cold-gas will get hit i think. if i hear anything on &#10;oil&#10;side ill be happy to pass it on-apprec comment on producers not that im&#10;surpirsed, wonder if they start going out further esp with forward sparks&#10;getting hit lately??&#10; good luck man-talk soon. pira was good. you go next year ill set up you &#10;some&#10;interesting people,good to network cuz we never know where we&apos;ll end up.&#10; by the way-you bullish sum 02/win 02 or are you rolling a short? non of my&#10;biz but i was on the other side-ill add if it narrows more. inkjections next&#10;summer will be huge albeit from low stx-curve will mean revert eventually.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

Pira certainly commands a lot of respect &#10;these days. Too much, probably.&#10;The problem with all these bull spreads (ie F-H) is the thought process in &#10;natty is that if Jan is strong, just think what happens when you get to March &#10;and run out of gas. The spread game is very different than playing crude. &#10;These spreads haven&apos;t moved for the past 1000 point runup. You know there &#10;were guys bullish this market trying to play it with spreads and haven&apos;t made &#10;a penny. &#10;Just to clarify, Pira said 3 bcf y on y for Z1?

EBS sell with, &#10;and/or through the Avaya sales organization&#10;&#10;&#10;The second day (only) would be for Avaya and EBS &#10;development/technical staff to meet and brainstorm the: &#10;1) results of the executive meetings&apos; output from 1&amp;2 above, &#10;discuss output of day 1 meetings, &amp; technical issues &#10;and opportunities&#10;and 2) what technical hurdles or opportunities exist which &#10;could enable successful EBS efforts to sell EBS solutions &#10; to Avaya and through Avaya or with Avaya&apos;s sales &amp; &#10;marketing team. Larry Ciscon may choose to attend both &#10;days due to the nature of his mission.&#10;&#10;&#10;++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++&#10;&#10;Please let me know as soon as you can which day or &#10;days would work best for you to make the trip.

The exchange, NYMEX, and I, Enron Online, offer a nearly &#10;identical product. The fight is over which execution model is superior. I &#10;would argue that technology will make open outcry exchanges extinct. It&apos;s &#10;happened in Europe already. The largest commodity exchange in Europe, the &#10;LIFFE, went with a parallel electronic system to open outcry. Within weeks, &#10;the floor was deserted and virtually all trading occurred electronically. I &#10;still trade on the exchange because we have credit issues with individuals &#10;and certain hedge funds that limit the trading we can do with them direct. &#10;The exchange still provides a credit intermediation function that is useful. &#10;It is certainly an issue that we are trying to address. &#10;John&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&quot;Bayer, Adam Ryan&quot; &lt;adam.r.bayer@vanderbilt.edu&gt; on 10/03/2000 01:23:01 PM&#10;To: John.Arnold@enron.com&#10;cc: &#10;Subject: Thank you for dinner last night&#10;&#10;&#10;Dear Mr. Arnold,&#10;&#10; It was nice to meet you yesterday at the&#10;information session. Thank you for the dinner last night.&#10;I had a great time getting to know Enron and its people in&#10;a more relaxed setting.&#10;&#10; During out conversation yesterday, I was confused&#10;about a point you made. You stated that you spent most of&#10;your time on the phone with Traders in New York. When&#10;you talk to the traders, do you try to steer them towards&#10;Enron Online, or are you doing trading outside of Enron&#10;Online? I think the underlying question that I am asking,&#10;is: Is Enron Online meant to facilitate a gas trader&apos;s job,&#10;or is it meant to bypass traders completely.&#10;&#10;Thanks again for your time and for dinner. I look forward&#10;to talking with you again when you come to campus for&#10;interviews.&#10;&#10;Cordially,&#10;&#10;Adam&#10;-----------------------------------------------------------------&#10;Bayer, Adam Ryan&#10;Vanderbilt University&#10;Email: adam.r.bayer@Vanderbilt.Edu&#10;&#10;&#10;</body></mail>

My&#10;short-term market patterns suggested a more robust price rally and natural&#10;appears to be waning at present. Volume on this rally is poor,&#10;particularly since yesterday was a decent day to the upside. The market&#10;appears to be using a lot of its energy but spinning its wheels. If we&#10;are at these same price levels in another two weeks, that would be&#10;extremely bullish. Right here, the risk/reward to being long is not so&#10;great. Recommend a neutral stance short-term on natural. Bigger picture&#10;is still very bullish. However, this market needs another 1-2 weeks of&#10;what I would call horizontal price action to set the stage for a big move&#10;to the upside.&#10;&#10;Let me know if this stuff is useful for you. I certainly don&apos;t want to&#10;waste your time. In addition, if you prefer I call when I have something&#10;to pass along, let me know. I don&apos;t know how often you check/see your&#10;e-mail.

You had 80 persons on the Complete Meeting Package. However,&#10;when coordinating with Tracey Kozadinos, she ordered and guaranteed 100 box&#10;lunches @ $5.50 per person surcharge for the golf. Thus, 80+40=120 - 100&#10;(box lunches) would leave 20 persons permitted to have lunch in The&#10;Woodlands Dining Room. We billed you for the total amount of persons over&#10;the 20 permitted in the Woodlands Dining Room.&#10;* JEFF: Breakout charges were for (2) rooms. Enron had a guarantee of&#10;120 attendees. We allow (1) breakout per 40 attendees. This particular&#10;day, (5) breakouts were ordered. The audio visual in the additional&#10;breakouts is based on a-la-carte pricing and is not included in the package.&#10;Only av is included in the rooms that are part of the allocation.&#10;&#10;Jeff, I will see that the adjustments are forwarded to you as soon as&#10;possible in order to remit for payment. Please feel free to call me should&#10;you have further questions. Thank you for your business!&#10;&#10;&#10;Beverly J.

Bill &#10;Perkins and I have a strong personal and professional relationship. He is an &#10;extremely creative individual. Whalley actually commented on him today as &#10;someone &quot;who thinks outside the box&quot;. Bill actually sat in a bar four years &#10;and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth. He has been &#10;successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas. &#10;As such he provides an informal consulting role to Enron. He throws out &#10;ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one. He pointed &#10;out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market I normally &#10;don&apos;t follow closely, that I translated into a multimillion dollar trade for &#10;Enron. In return, I have agreed to have Enron intermediate his trades within &#10;reason. I want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be &#10;considered a high priority. I am willing to accept some of the credit risk &#10;exposure as a cost of doing business. Bill understands his role as an &#10;independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for &#10;someone with finite capital. I place very high confidence in Bill not &#10;conducting high risk trades. Having said that, we certainly need to monitor &#10;his credit exposure and continue to require LC&apos;s. Just understand that he is &#10;at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade &#10;counterparty.&#10;&#10;I understand there was some concern in regards to the Transco Z6 spread &#10;option he traded. He was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the &#10;trading desk, knew it as well. There are a couple isolated products that &#10;Enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations. This &#10;was one product. Our spread options are booked in Excel using option pricing &#10;models created by the research group. The problem with these models is that &#10;they are strictly theoretical and don&apos;t take into account gas fundamental &#10;price limitations. For instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, &#10;for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within &#10;variable cost than the models predict. Thus it is necessary to apply a &#10;correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used. Obviously, &#10;we have this function in our pricing models. I was not aware this &#10;methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models. This has since &#10;been changed. Fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very &#10;few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products. &#10;&#10;Finally, on Friday Bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to &#10;Enron. I gave Mike Maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting &#10;credit. I do not believe that I acted out of line in approving this trade &#10;considering the circumstances. If you believe differently, please advise.&#10;Thanks, &#10;John</body></mail>

Under the &#10;$7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price &#10;curves proportionally shifted. Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the &#10;price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX &#10;volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.&#10;&#10;&#10;Key findings include:&#10;$7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79% &#10;$9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% &#10;&#10; &#10;&#10;It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the &#10;financial desk actually decreased. This would seem to imply that up to the &#10;seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces &#10;risk). But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that &#10;the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and &#10;increasing VaR by 74%.

We want the orders open as long as possible. &#10;Now, it is more work to keep the order open for 12 hours than for 1 hour. &#10;Traditionally, limit orders are a day order, good for the entire trading &#10;session unless specified otherwise. &#10;&#10;2. Today Pete had 13,000/ day on his bid because he was hit for small size. &#10;When I tried to place a limit order, the quantity had to be in 5,000 &#10;increments of 13,000 (i.e. 3000, 8000, 18000...). I could not overwrite the &#10;quantity to be 15,000. &#10;&#10;3. Everytime a limit order is placed, an error message occurs on the system &#10;saying error trade, price not available.&#10;&#10;4. Is there a way to modify a limit order, such as changing the price, &#10;without canceling it and resubmitting a new one? If not, this would be a &#10;valuable feature.&#10;&#10;Thx,&#10;John</body></mail>

MG clears their own trades and &#10;maybe some for other customers. He indicated that his cost for clearing is &#10;$3.05 round turn. If this is accurate, we need to evaluate whether clearing &#10;ourselves and issuing cp every night is less expensive than paying a higher &#10;clearing rate and getting access to financing. This is a question I hope &#10;your analysis of the true cost of clearing will answer. &#10;&#10;Also, fyi, over the past two days I have done two 6,000 lot EFP&apos;s with El &#10;Paso under the same structure I explained to you previously whereby long &#10;futures are transferred from his account to mine to lower initial margin &#10;costs. </body></mail>
